This paper first\nproposes a two-step strategic brain-muscular-hand interface (BMHI) based on\nbiological evolutionary selection mechanism, by integrating the brain-muscle\n(BM) interface with the muscle-hand (MH) interface through crosstalk (\"BMHI =\nBM + MH\"). To verify the effectiveness of BMHI and the advantages of a two-step\nstrategy inspired by natural evolution, we conducted offline, comparison\n(comparing BMHI (two-step) and brain-hand interface (one-step)), and online\nexperiments (using BMHI to control a virtual/machine hand for daily tasks). The\nresults show that: (1) BMHI is feasible and the prediction accuracy is 0.79;\n(2) Unlike traditional multi-layer neural networks that attempt to establish a\ndirect brain-signal-to-action mapping through a single end-to-end process\n(brain-hand interface), BMHI incorporates the neuro-muscular transmission\nmechanisms evolved in biological systems as an intermediate constraint layer.\nThis phased decoding strategy can reduce training time by approximately 18-fold\nand improve decoding accuracy; (3) In the online control experiment, both the\nvirtual hand and the manipulator were able to successfully complete tasks, like\nmoving objects such as boxes or plates and holding water glasses.

The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been\nmodelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more\nrecently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models.\nModelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory\nprocessing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for\ntraining DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken\nadvantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory\nmidbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this\nmodel assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore\nit cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.\n  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space\nof hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory\nmidbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised\nby only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\\% of the\nexplainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68%\nfor hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the\nart animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to\nsimulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the\nlearned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving\ncrossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more\nanimals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen\nanimals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss\ncompensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing\nimpaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the\nloop optimisation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5065\u5eb7\u52a8\u7269\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u66b4\u9732\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u542c\u89c9\u4e2d\u8111\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ec5\u97006\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u7269\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u542c\u89c9\u5927\u8111\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9ad8\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u624b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3DNN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u542c\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5927\u8111\u4e2d\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u5065\u5eb7\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u66b4\u9732\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u542c\u89c9\u4e2d\u8111\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ec5\u97006\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6b63\u5e38\u542c\u529b\u52a8\u726962%\u548c\u542c\u529b\u53d7\u635f\u52a8\u726968%\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u7269\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u970015-30\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5373\u53ef\u62df\u5408\u65b0\u52a8\u7269\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u8865\u507f\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u62df\u5408\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u76f4\u63a5\u6062\u590d\u542c\u529b\u53d7\u635f\u5927\u8111\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u3002"}}
