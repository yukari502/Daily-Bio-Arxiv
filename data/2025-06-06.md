### [1] [A note on metapopulation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04284)
*Diepreye Ayabina,Hasan Sevil,Adam Kleczkowski,M. Gabriela M. Gomes*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: 本文研究了传染病流行病学中个体在斑块内变异的影响，忽略斑块间传播，发现忽略斑块内异质性会低估基本再生数（$\mathcal{R}_{0}$）和防控努力，并提出了一种推断个体易感性分布的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究斑块内个体变异对传染病传播的影响，补充传统斑块间迁移模型的不足。

Method: 通过忽略斑块间传播，分析斑块内个体异质性对$\mathcal{R}_{0}$和防控努力的影响，并提出基于斑块分层的个体易感性推断方法。

Result: 忽略斑块内异质性会低估$\mathcal{R}_{0}$和防控需求；提出的推断方法可用于COVID-19等案例。

Conclusion: 斑块内个体异质性对传染病传播有重要影响，需在模型中加以考虑以提高预测和防控效果。

Abstract: Metapopulation models are commonly used in ecology, evolution, and
epidemiology. These models usually entail homogeneity assumptions within
patches and study networks of migration between patches to generate insights
into conservation of species, differentiation of populations, and persistence
of infectious diseases. Here, focusing on infectious disease epidemiology, we
take a complementary approach and study the effects of individual variation
within patches while neglecting any form of disease transmission between
patches. Consistently with previous work on single populations, we show how
metapopulation models that neglect in-patch heterogeneity also underestimate
basic reproduction numbers ($\mathcal{R}_{0}$) and the effort required to
control or eliminate infectious diseases by uniform interventions. We then go
beyond this confirmatory result and introduce a scheme to infer distributions
of individual susceptibility or exposure to infection based on suitable
stratifications of a population into patches. We apply the resulting
metapopulation models to a simple case study of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### [2] [Viral Hitchhikers and Macroevolution: A Novel Hypothesis on Explosive Speciation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04511)
*Mario E. Lozano,Marcela G. Pilloff*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: 该论文提出内源性病毒元素（EVEs）通过水平转移和基因组整合，可能成为适应性辐射和新物种形成的催化剂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨内源性病毒元素在基因组变化、物种形成和适应性辐射中的作用，尤其是在K-Pg事件期间哺乳动物辐射的背景下。

Method: 理论分析，提出EVEs通过整合宿主基因组、诱导染色体重排和水平转移，影响物种形成。

Result: EVEs及其母病毒可能通过同步影响多个个体，促进生殖隔离和新物种的快速形成。

Conclusion: 内源性病毒可能是爆炸性物种形成的催化剂，尤其是在病毒流行期间。

Abstract: Mobile genetic elements (e.g., endogenous viruses, LINEs, SINEs) can transfer
between genomes, even between species, triggering dramatic genetic changes.
Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) arise when infectious viruses integrate into
the host germline. EVEs integrate at specific sites; their genes or regulatory
regions can be exapted and could induce chromosomal rearrangement. We propose
that EVEs participate in adaptive radiations and that their parent viruses,
through interspecific transfer, could initiate new species formation. By
synchronously affecting multiple individuals, viral outbreaks generate shared
genomic changes that both facilitate reproductive isolation and provide the
simultaneous modifications needed for groups to emerge as founders of new
species. We suggest horizontal viral transfer during the K-Pg accelerated
mammalian radiation linking viral epidemics to macroevolutionary
diversification. This theoretical work proposes endogenous viruses as catalysts
for explosive speciation.

### [3] [Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235)
*Xinyan Zhao,Yi-Ching Tang,Akshita Singh,Victor J Cantu,KwanHo An,Junseok Lee,Adam E Stogsdill,Ashwin Kumar Ramesh,Zhiqiang An,Xiaoqian Jiang,Yejin Kim*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一个抗体结合亲和力成熟与设计的基准框架，通过评估抗体-抗原复合物的功能潜力，系统比较了14种蛋白质模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体评估方法仅关注抗体本身或其与天然抗体的相似性，而AbBiBench旨在提供一个更全面的功能评估框架。

Method: AbBiBench通过标准化9个数据集（包含155,853个重链突变抗体）和14种蛋白质模型，利用模型似然与实验亲和力的相关性评估性能。

Result: 结构条件逆向折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: AbBiBench为开发更有效的功能感知抗体设计模型提供了统一的生物学评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [4] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)
*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于潜在空间假设的医学数据分析框架，将多模态医学数据映射到统一的学习几何表示中，以支持个性化诊断和治疗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据多模态且复杂，但可能共享相同的生理状态信息。潜在空间假设旨在统一这些数据，揭示疾病进展和治疗的几何表示。

Method: 通过潜在空间假设，将多模态医学数据映射到统一的学习几何表示中，利用轨迹和向量描述疾病进展和治疗干预。

Result: 该框架能够揭示疾病的子轨迹和患者特异性变化方向，为个性化医疗提供定量依据。

Conclusion: 潜在空间假设为个性化医疗提供了新思路，但仍需解决数据偏差、稀缺性和隐私等挑战。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

### [5] [Bacterial Chemotaxis in a Traveling Wave Attractant Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04702)
*Shobhan Dev Mandal,Sakuntala Chatterjee*

Main category: q-bio.CB

TL;DR: 研究了单细胞大肠杆菌在时空变化的吸引物环境中的趋化行为，发现趋化漂移速度随吸引物波速呈现非单调变化，包括符号反转和多峰值现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索单细胞在动态环境中的趋化行为，揭示其漂移速度与吸引物波速的复杂关系。

Method: 通过模拟时空变化的吸引物浓度（正弦波形式），测量不同波速下的趋化漂移速度。

Result: 趋化漂移速度随波速变化呈现负峰值、符号反转、正峰值直至归零的复杂行为。

Conclusion: 细胞在波速匹配时能“骑乘”波而感知不到梯度，导致漂移速度的反直觉行为。

Abstract: We study single cell E.coli chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying
attractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a
traveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift
velocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We
find a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity
changes sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave,
drift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave
propagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak,
then changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the
wave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from
the difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run
along the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the
cell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell
with respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run
speed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no
concentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the
opposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient
increases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed
quantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the
counter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.

### [6] [Assessing parameter identifiability of a hemodynamics PDE model using spectral surrogates and dimension reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04538)
*Mitchel J. Colebank*

Main category: q-bio.TO

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用多项式混沌展开（PCEs）进行多输出全局敏感性分析和参数可识别性评估的创新方法，解决了生物医学模拟器中参数排名和固定的启发式问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学模拟器的计算逆问题通常面临数据有限和参数维度高的挑战，尤其是在构建医学数字孪生时，需要高效的参数敏感性分析和可识别性评估。

Method: 采用多项式混沌展开（PCEs）进行多输出全局敏感性分析，并结合降维技术量化一维肺血流动力学模型的时间序列敏感性；利用PCEs构建轮廓似然置信区间，评估参数可识别性。

Result: 研究展示了实验设计变化如何改善参数可识别性，并验证了PCEs在偏微分方程问题中实现轮廓似然分析的可行性。

Conclusion: 该工作为参数可识别性分析提供了新方法，并利用PCEs为偏微分方程问题中的轮廓似然分析提供了通用仿真策略。

Abstract: Computational inverse problems for biomedical simulators suffer from limited
data and relatively high parameter dimensionality. This often requires
sensitivity analysis, where parameters of the model are ranked based on their
influence on the specific quantities of interest. This is especially important
for simulators used to build medical digital twins, as the amount of data is
typically limited. For expensive models, such as blood flow models, emulation
is employed to expedite the simulation time. Parameter ranking and fixing using
sensitivity analysis are often heuristic, though, and vary with the specific
application or simulator used. The present study provides an innovative
solution to this problem by leveraging polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) for
both multioutput global sensitivity analysis and formal parameter
identifiability. For the former, we use dimension reduction to efficiently
quantify time-series sensitivity of a one-dimensional pulmonary hemodynamics
model. We consider both Windkessel and structured tree boundary conditions. We
then use PCEs to construct profile-likelihood confidence intervals to formally
assess parameter identifiability, and show how changes in experimental design
improve identifiability. Our work presents a novel approach to determining
parameter identifiability and leverages a common emulation strategy for
enabling profile-likelihood analysis in problems governed by partial
differential equations.

*Gage K. R. Hooper*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: GAIN模型采用基于网格的结构，提升生物合理性和模型动态性，结合Izhikevich模型实现高效且生物准确的模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进神经网络的生物合理性和动态性，模拟生物神经元间的交互。

Method: 使用网格结构促进神经元与最近邻的交互，结合Izhikevich模型。

Result: 实现了计算高效且生物准确的模拟，适用于神经网络开发和大规模仿真。

Conclusion: GAIN模型通过网格结构和Izhikevich模型提升了动态性和准确性，适用于神经科学领域。

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

### [8] [Discounting and Drug Seeking in Biological Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04549)
*Vardhan Palod,Pranav Mahajan,Veeky Baths,Boris S. Gutkin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了长期物质使用障碍（SUD）患者的行为冲突机制，提出了一种基于分层强化学习（HRL）的模型，解释了药物奖励如何导致行为选择对负面后果不敏感，并验证了高折扣率与成瘾严重性的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解成瘾行为中认知与行为的冲突机制，尤其是药物奖励如何通过神经生物学机制影响决策过程。

Method: 方法包括构建一个分层强化学习（HRL）模型，整合时间折扣效应，模拟药物奖励对行为选择的影响。

Result: 结果显示高折扣率会放大药物寻求行为，与成瘾严重性和冲动性相关，并与实证研究一致。

Conclusion: 结论认为成瘾是一种分层决策障碍，模型为理解成瘾行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite a strong desire to quit, individuals with long-term substance use
disorder (SUD) often struggle to resist drug use, even when aware of its
harmful consequences. This disconnect between knowledge and compulsive behavior
reflects a fundamental cognitive-behavioral conflict in addiction.
Neurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity within striatal
subregions, along with dopamine-mediated connectivity from the ventral to the
dorsal striatum, contributes to compulsive drug-seeking. However, the
functional mechanism linking these findings to behavioral conflict remains
unclear. Another hallmark of addiction is temporal discounting: individuals
with drug dependence exhibit steeper discount rates than non-users. Assuming
the ventral-dorsal striatal organization reflects a gradient from cognitive to
motor representations, addiction can be modeled within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework. However, integrating discounting into
biologically grounded HRL remains an open challenge. In this work, we build on
a model showing how action choices reinforced with drug rewards become
insensitive to the negative consequences that follow. We address the
integration of discounting by ensuring natural reward values converge across
all levels in the HRL hierarchy, while drug rewards diverge due to their
dopaminergic effects. Our results show that high discounting amplifies
drug-seeking across the hierarchy, linking faster discounting with increased
addiction severity and impulsivity. We demonstrate alignment with empirical
findings on temporal discounting and propose testable predictions, establishing
addiction as a disorder of hierarchical decision-making.

### [9] [Consciousness via MIPT?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04875)
*Alexander Gorsky*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了测量诱导相变（MIPT）在认知网络生成模型和意识状态形成中的作用，提出了探针-目标模型，并将MIPT解释为可学习性相变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MIPT在非平衡系统中的现象，并探索其在认知网络和意识形成中的潜在作用。

Method: 提出探针-目标模型，将MIPT解释为认知网络中概念的可学习性相变，并与探针中的同步相变进行比较。

Result: 发现MIPT可能在认知网络的生成模型和意识状态形成中起关键作用。

Conclusion: MIPT作为可学习性相变，可能在认知网络和意识形成中具有重要意义。

Abstract: The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a recently formulated
phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium systems. The competition between unitary
evolutions and measurement-induced non-unitaries leads to the transition
between the entangled and disentangled phases at some critical measurement
rate. We conjecture that self-organized MIPT plays a key role in the generative
model of cognitive networks and the formation of the state of consciousness in
the "newborn-adult" transition. To this aim, we formulate the probe-target
picture for the brain and suggest that MIPT interpreted as learnability
transition takes place in the mental part of the target where the sites in the
cognitive networks of semantic memory are concepts. Comparison with the
synchronization phase transitions in the probe is made.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新的对比学习框架，通过平均不同试验子集生成正对，用于神经时间序列数据的表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经记录技术（如双光子成像）生成了大量神经元响应的时间序列数据，但现有方法未充分利用多试验数据结构。

Method: TRACE结合对比学习和邻居嵌入思想，直接学习二维嵌入，通过平均不同试验子集生成正对。

Result: TRACE在模拟数据中表现优于其他方法，能够分辨细微响应差异；在活体记录中，其表示捕捉了生物相关的连续变异和细胞类型聚类结构。

Conclusion: TRACE是一种有效的神经时间序列表示学习方法，可用于数据质量控制。

Abstract: Modern neural recording techniques such as two-photon imaging allow to
acquire vast time-series datasets with responses of hundreds or thousands of
neurons. Contrastive learning is a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning representations of complex datasets. Existing applications for neural
time series rely on generic data augmentations and do not exploit the
multi-trial data structure inherent in many neural datasets. Here we present
TRACE, a new contrastive learning framework that averages across different
subsets of trials to generate positive pairs. TRACE allows to directly learn a
two-dimensional embedding, combining ideas from contrastive learning and
neighbor embeddings. We show that TRACE outperforms other methods, resolving
fine response differences in simulated data. Further, using in vivo recordings,
we show that the representations learned by TRACE capture both biologically
relevant continuous variation, cell-type-related cluster structure, and can
assist data quality control.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，解释海马体如何通过网格细胞输入的线性投影形成连续梯度的大小不同的位置场，并揭示了这种多尺度组织的功能意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决海马体位置场大小梯度形成的原理，以及如何从离散的网格细胞输入生成连续梯度。

Method: 通过数学分析和模拟，提出网格细胞到位置场的连接权重随频率衰减的理论框架，并验证其在少样本学习中的最优性。

Result: 研究表明，位置场大小梯度平衡了精度和泛化的权衡，并揭示了环境结构对最优位置场大小的影响。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为位置场梯度提供了原理性解释，并为生物和人工智能中的自适应学习提供了可测试的预测。

Abstract: The hippocampus encodes space through a striking gradient of place field
sizes along its dorsal-ventral axis, yet the principles generating this
continuous gradient from discrete grid cell inputs remain debated. We propose a
unified theoretical framework establishing that hippocampal place fields arise
naturally as linear projections of grid cell population activity, interpretable
as eigenmodes. Critically, we demonstrate that a frequency-dependent decay of
these grid-to-place connection weights naturally transforms inputs from
discrete grid modules into a continuous spectrum of place field sizes. This
multiscale organization is functionally significant: we reveal it shapes the
inductive bias of the population code, balancing a fundamental trade-off
between precision and generalization. Mathematical analysis and simulations
demonstrate an optimal place field size for few-shot learning, which scales
with environment structure. Our results offer a principled explanation for the
place field gradient and generate testable predictions, bridging anatomical
connectivity with adaptive learning in both biological and artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: POSSM是一种新型混合架构，结合了跨注意力模块的单个尖峰标记化和递归状态空间模型（SSM）主干，旨在实现快速、因果的在线神经活动预测，并通过多数据集预训练高效泛化到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法（如简单循环神经网络）泛化能力不足，以及Transformer方法计算资源需求高、不适合实时或低资源环境的问题。

Method: 提出POSSM架构，结合跨注意力模块的尖峰标记化和SSM主干，支持多数据集预训练。

Result: 在猴子和人类任务中，POSSM的解码精度与最先进的Transformer相当，但推理速度更快（GPU上快达9倍）。

Conclusion: 混合SSM是平衡准确性、推理速度和泛化能力的有前景方法，适用于实时闭环神经解码应用。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: 论文探讨了联想记忆模型（如Hopfield网络）在高阶交互下的“黑障灾难”现象，提出动态视角下即使超过容量限制，模式仍可被短暂高精度检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统平衡视角认为超过容量限制后网络不可用，但作者认为这是视角局限，希望通过动态分析揭示更多可能性。

Method: 使用二分腔方法和动态平均场方程，结合数值方案分析高阶交互的联想记忆模型。

Result: 发现即使超过容量限制，模式仍可通过不稳定浅盆地短暂检索，且动态恢复曲线展示了非灾难性变化。

Conclusion: 动态视角揭示了传统平衡分析忽略的丰富能量景观结构，为生物神经回路利用瞬态动态提供理论支持，并推动了Hopfield模型的扩展研究。

Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense
generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout
catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly
vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This
transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity
limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the
equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a
bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models,
with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical
scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy
above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because
slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape as shallow,
unstable remnants of below-capacity stable basins. The same transient-retrieval
effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of
attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of
these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval
behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across
interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape
structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural
circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our
approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural
circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire
of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and
yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于激活最大化技术的方法，用于解释DNN编码模型对人类大脑视觉系统的响应，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN编码模型能准确预测大脑对视觉刺激的响应，但缺乏对驱动这些响应的具体特征的理解。

Method: 使用预训练的Inception V3网络提取并自适应下采样激活，通过线性回归预测fMRI响应，并应用激活最大化生成优化图像。

Result: 生成的图像与已知选择性特征相符，并能可靠驱动目标脑区活动。

Conclusion: 激活最大化可成功应用于DNN编码模型，为人类视觉系统的响应特征提供了灵活的表征和调控方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

Conclusion: 互动顺序在长期进化中至关重要，环境反馈是稳定异步合作的关键因素。

Abstract: Cooperation is vital for the survival of living systems but is challenging
due to the costs borne by altruistic individuals. Direct reciprocity, where
actions are based on past encounters, is a key mechanism fostering cooperation.
However, most studies assume synchronous decision-making, whereas real-world
interactions are often asynchronous, with individuals acting in sequence. This
asynchrony can undermine standard cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat and
Win-Stay Lose-Shift. To better understand cooperation in real-world contexts,
it is crucial to explore the theory of direct reciprocity in asynchronous
interactions. To address this, we introduce a framework based on asynchronous
stochastic games, incorporating asynchronous decisions and dynamic
environmental feedback. We analytically derive the conditions under which
strategies form cooperative Nash equilibria. Our results demonstrate that the
order of interactions can significantly alter outcomes: interaction asynchrony
generally inhibits cooperation, except under specific conditions where
environmental feedback effectively mitigates its negative impact. When
environmental feedback is incorporated, a variety of stable reciprocal
strategies can be sustained. Notably, above a critical environmental threshold,
any cooperative strategy can form a Nash equilibrium. Overall, our work
underscores the importance of interaction order in long-term evolutionary
processes and highlights the pivotal role of environmental feedback in
stabilizing cooperation in asynchronous interactions.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer在不同学习机制下（参数内学习与上下文学习）处理传递推理任务的能力，发现参数内学习自然支持传递推理，而上下文学习需特定预训练才能实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer在传递推理任务中的表现机制，比较不同学习机制（参数内学习与上下文学习）的差异。

Method: 通过实验比较参数内学习（IWL）和上下文学习（ICL）在传递推理任务中的表现，并进行机制分析。

Result: IWL自然支持传递推理，而ICL需预训练才能实现。预训练后，ICL模型表现出类似人类的推理特征。

Conclusion: 预训练具有结构化任务可促进上下文学习中的关系推理能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz为动态生物分子复合物的结构预测提供了一种灵活且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Conclusion: 研究为理解生成与记忆之间的过渡提供了理论支持，并验证了经典和现代Hopfield网络的结构稳定性。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Conclusion: cGSA在黑色素瘤和乳腺癌的案例研究中展示了其揭示上下文特异性见解和生成针对性假设的潜力。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.
