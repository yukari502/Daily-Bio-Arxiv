A position paper examining the latent space\n  hypothesis - the proposition that diverse medical data can be represented in\n  shared latent spaces reflecting fundamental biological processes. The paper\n  discusses theoretical foundations, reviews supporting evidence, and considers\n  potential implications for medical AI and representation learning", "summary": "Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to\nstructured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although\nthese modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a\nsingle underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each\nobservation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --\nmuch like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this\nlearned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a\npoint, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention\ncorresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a\nshared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --\nsuch as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological\nentities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By\nrevealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the\nframework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,\nlongitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away\nfrom grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each\nperson's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data\nscarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --\nbut scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and\nperturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward."}
