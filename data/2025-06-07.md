TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于潜在空间假设的框架，将多模态医学数据映射到统一的几何表示中，以支持个性化诊断和治疗。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据多模态且分散，但可能共享同一生理状态信息，需要一种统一的方法来整合和解释这些数据。

Method: 采用潜在空间假设，将观察数据视为统一流形的投影，通过几何表示建模健康状态、疾病进展和治疗干预。

Result: 框架能够揭示疾病的子轨迹和患者特异性变化方向，为个性化医疗提供定量依据。

Conclusion: 该框架有望推动临床实践从标签分组转向个体化轨迹导航，但仍需解决数据偏见、稀缺性和隐私等挑战。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.
