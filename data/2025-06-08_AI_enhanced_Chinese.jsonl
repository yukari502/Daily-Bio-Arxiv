Unlike existing\nantibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity\nto natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench\nconsiders an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and\nevaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by\nmeasuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,\nstandardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,\nanti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain\nmutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein\nmodels including masked language models, autoregressive language models,\ninverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph\nmodels. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity\nvalues is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to\nincrease binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we\nevaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of\nnew antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural\nintegrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,\nstructure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity\ncorrelation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,\nbiologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of\nmore effective, function-aware antibody design models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AbBiBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6297\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6210\u719f\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6297\u4f53-\u6297\u539f\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5355\u5143\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6297\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6297\u4f53\u672c\u8eab\u6216\u5176\u4e0e\u5929\u7136\u6297\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6297\u4f53-\u6297\u539f\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "AbBiBench\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u86cb\u767d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6297\u4f53-\u6297\u539f\u590d\u5408\u7269\u4e0a\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6297\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8614\u79cd\u86cb\u767d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u9006\u5411\u6298\u53e0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "AbBiBench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6297\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although\nthese modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a\nsingle underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each\nobservation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --\nmuch like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this\nlearned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a\npoint, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention\ncorresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a\nshared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --\nsuch as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological\nentities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By\nrevealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the\nframework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,\nlongitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away\nfrom grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each\nperson's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data\nscarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --\nbut scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and\nperturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLatent Space Hypothesis\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u751f\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Latent Space Hypothesis\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}
