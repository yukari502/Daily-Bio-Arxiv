Abstract: Distinguishing one person from another (what biometricians call recognition)
is extremely relevant for different aspects of life. Traditional biometric
modalities (fingerprint, face, iris, voice) rely on unique, stable features
that reliably differentiate individuals. Recently, the term fingerprinting has
gained popularity in neuroscience, with a growing number of studies adopting
the term to describe various brain based metrics derived from different
techniques. However, we think there is a mismatch between its widely accepted
meaning in the biometric community and some brain based metrics. Many of these
measures do not satisfy the strict definition of a biometric fingerprint that
is, a stable trait that uniquely identifies an individual. In this study we
discuss some issues that may generate confusion in this context and suggest how
to treat the question in the future. In particular, we review how fingerprint
is currently used in the neuroscience literature, highlight mismatches with the
biometric community definition, and offer clear guidelines for distinguishing
genuine biometric fingerprints from exploratory similarity metrics. By
clarifying terminology and criteria, we aim to align practices and facilitate
communication across fields.

### [2] [Cancer model with moving extinction threshold reproduces real cancer data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05992)

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态癌症发展模型，将免疫系统作为灭绝阈值，类似种群生物学中的强Allee效应，并改进了现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Allee效应模型在模拟癌症进展时存在局限，需结合随机突变和随时间变化的免疫响应来更准确描述癌症发展。

Method: 新模型结合了干细胞随机突变率随年龄增加和免疫响应强度随时间变化的特点，并引入移动灭绝阈值以反映免疫响应的动态变化。

Result: 模型能准确模拟多种癌症数据，包括人类癌症的年龄特异性累积风险、小鼠乳腺癌进展及女性乳腺癌的特殊风险模式。

Conclusion: 移动阈值方法为激素替代疗法和月经周期长度的影响提供了新见解，并可推广到其他免疫响应动态变化的癌症场景。

Abstract: We propose a simple dynamic model of cancer development that captures
carcinogenesis and subsequent cancer progression. A central idea of the model
is to include the immune system as an extinction threshold, similar to the
strong Allee effect in population biology. We first identify the limitations of
commonly used Allee effect models in reproducing typical cancer progression. We
then address these limitations by deriving a new model that incorporates: (i)
random mutations of stem cells at a rate that increases with age and (ii)
immune response whose strength may also vary over time.
  Our model accurately reproduces a wide range of real-world cancer data: the
typical age-specific cumulative risk of most human cancers, the progression of
breast cancer in mice, and the unusual age-specific cumulative risk of breast
cancer in women. In the last case, we use a moving extinction threshold to
reflect the different immune response at different phases of the menstrual
cycle and menopausal treatment. This provides new insights into the effects of
hormone replacement therapy and menstrual cycle length. This moving threshold
approach can be applied to a variety of other cancer scenarios where the immune
response or other important factors may vary over time.

### [3] [Bayesian variable selection in a Cox proportional hazards model with the "Sum of Single Effects" prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06233)
*Yunqi Yang,Karl Tayeb,Peter Carbonetto,Xiaoyuan Zhong,Carole Ober,Matthew Stephens*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的贝叶斯变量选择回归方法（CoxPH-SuSiE），用于处理遗传精细定位中的时间到事件（TTE）数据，解决了高相关性和大规模数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对遗传精细定位中的高相关性协变量和大规模数据集问题，提出新的方法。

Method: 扩展了“Sum of Single Effects”（SuSiE）方法，应用于Cox比例风险模型（CoxPH）。

Result: 在模拟数据中优于现有方法，并在UK Biobank的真实数据中识别出14个哮喘风险SNP，其中6个具有强因果证据。

Conclusion: CoxPH-SuSiE方法在遗传精细定位中表现出色，能够有效识别因果变异。

Abstract: Motivated by genetic fine-mapping applications, we introduce a new approach
to Bayesian variable selection regression (BVSR) for time-to-event (TTE)
outcomes. This new approach is designed to deal with the specific challenges
that arise in genetic fine-mapping, including: the presence of very strong
correlations among the covariates, often exceeding 0.99; very large data sets
containing potentially thousands of covariates and hundreds of thousands of
samples. We accomplish this by extending the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE)
method to the Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model. We demonstrate the
benefits of the new method, "CoxPH-SuSiE", over existing BVSR methods for TTE
outcomes in simulated fine-mapping data sets. We also illustrate CoxPH-SuSiE on
real data by fine-mapping asthma loci using data from UK Biobank. This
fine-mapping identified 14 asthma risk SNPs in 8 asthma risk loci, among which
6 had strong evidence for being causal (posterior inclusion probability greater
than 50%). Two of the 6 putatively causal variants are known to be pathogenic,
and others lie within a genomic sequence that is known to regulate the
expression of GATA3.

Conclusion: 为全面理解蛋白质结合强度，需研究两个分离伴侣的稳定性。

Abstract: The functionality of protein-protein complexes is closely tied to the
strength of their interactions, making the evaluation of binding affinity a
central focus in structural biology. However, the molecular determinants
underlying binding affinity are still not fully understood. In particular, the
entropic contributions, especially those arising from conformational dynamics,
remain poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the relationship between
protein motion and binding stability and its role in protein function. To gain
deeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we
investigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary
history: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2
receptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through
Molecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical
differences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike
protein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more
stable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in
their unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed
after binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole
driving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized
by a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but
could optimize other traits, such as antibody escape. These results suggest
that to fully understand the strength of the binding between two proteins, the
stability of the two isolated partners should be investigated.

Abstract: The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys
metabolic state and behaviors related to survival. Despite its importance
however, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections
of the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As
a heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of
different subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the
cortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have
either treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches
that are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we
used resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven
analytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human
hypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions
based on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct
patterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic
subregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical
Network 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and
weaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of
posterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic
subregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to
Cortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior
hypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity.
The findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in
providing a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects
its complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.

TL;DR: 通过结合SIMS多同位素测量和统计推断方法，揭示了等基因蓝藻种群中两种代谢簇的存在，优化碳或氮的利用，并通过代谢交换实现部分异养生长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在从单细胞层面理解等基因蓝藻种群的代谢异质性及其对群体表型的影响。

Method: 结合二次离子质谱（SIMS）多同位素测量、Liebig最小定律、最大熵原理和约束建模的统计推断方法。

Result: 种群分为两种代谢簇：一种优化碳利用但过度消耗氮，另一种反之。代谢交换扩展了代谢空间，混合营养细胞生长最快。

Conclusion: 单细胞代谢异质性为理解群体表型提供了基础，揭示了代谢交换的重要性。

Abstract: We derive a single-cell level understanding of metabolism in an isogenic
cyanobacterial population by integrating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
derived multi-isotope uptake measurements of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 with a
statistical inference protocol based on Liebig's law of the minimum, the
maximum entropy principle, and constraint-based modeling. We find the
population is structured in two metabolically distinct clusters: cells
optimizing carbon yield while excessively turning over nitrogen, and cells
which act reciprocally, optimizing nitrogen yield and excessively turning over
carbon. This partition enables partial heterotrophy within the population via
metabolic exchange, likely in the form of organic acids. Exchange increases the
feasible metabolic space, and mixotrophic cells achieve the fastest growth
rates. Metabolic flux analysis at the single-cell level reveals heterogeneity
in carbon fixation rates, Rubisco specificity, and nitrogen assimilation. Our
results provide a necessary foundation for understanding how population level
phenotypes arise from the collective contributions of distinct individuals.
