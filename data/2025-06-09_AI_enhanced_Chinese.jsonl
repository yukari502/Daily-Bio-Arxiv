Through\nMolecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical\ndifferences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike\nprotein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more\nstable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in\ntheir unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed\nafter binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole\ndriving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized\nby a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but\ncould optimize other traits, such as antibody escape.

Despite its importance\nhowever, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections\nof the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As\na heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of\ndifferent subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the\ncortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have\neither treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches\nthat are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we\nused resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven\nanalytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human\nhypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions\nbased on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct\npatterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic\nsubregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical\nNetwork 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and\nweaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of\nposterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic\nsubregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to\nCortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior\nhypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity.\nThe findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in\nproviding a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects\nits complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u75287\u7279\u65af\u62c9fMRI\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0b\u4e18\u8111\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u4e9a\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u76ae\u8d28\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0b\u4e18\u8111\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e9a\u533a\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u76ae\u8d28\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e18\u8111\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75287\u7279\u65af\u62c9fMRI\u9759\u606f\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0b\u4e18\u8111\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e9a\u533a\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u76ae\u8d28\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u4e9a\u533a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u524d\u4e0b\u4e18\u8111\u4e0e\u76ae\u8d28\u7f51\u7edc1\uff08\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u3001\u4e2d\u7ebf\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u76ae\u8d28\uff09\u8fde\u63a5\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u8179\u4fa7\u4e9a\u533a\u8fde\u63a5\u6700\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u9ad8\u573a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e0b\u4e18\u8111\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This new approach is designed to deal with the specific challenges\nthat arise in genetic fine-mapping, including: the presence of very strong\ncorrelations among the covariates, often exceeding 0.99; very large data sets\ncontaining potentially thousands of covariates and hundreds of thousands of\nsamples. We accomplish this by extending the \"Sum of Single Effects\" (SuSiE)\nmethod to the Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of the new method, \"CoxPH-SuSiE\", over existing BVSR methods for TTE\noutcomes in simulated fine-mapping data sets. We also illustrate CoxPH-SuSiE on\nreal data by fine-mapping asthma loci using data from UK Biobank. This\nfine-mapping identified 14 asthma risk SNPs in 8 asthma risk loci, among which\n6 had strong evidence for being causal (posterior inclusion probability greater\nthan 50%).
