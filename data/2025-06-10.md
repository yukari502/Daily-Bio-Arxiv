### [1] [Antibody Consumption-Driven Dynamic Competition: A Systems Hypothesis for the Transition from Acute Immune Response to Post-Infection Sequelae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06413)
*Shi Qiru*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的机制，即“抗体克隆的消耗驱动动态竞争”，用于解释感染后后遗症的形成。该机制结合了Bystryn的抗体反馈现象和Imbiakha的免疫成本理论，强调抗体消耗率对B细胞克隆增殖和分化的调控作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 感染后后遗症的形成机制复杂且存在争议，现有理论未能完全解释其动态演化和个体差异性。

Method: 提出“消耗驱动动态竞争”模型，分为抗原增长、抗原衰减和稳态重建三个阶段，分析抗体克隆竞争对后遗症的影响。

Result: 该模型为理解感染后免疫结果的动态变化提供了统一框架，包括急性症状、慢性后遗症的形成及缓解。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了免疫系统中宏观竞争动态的重要性，为后遗症干预策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: The mechanisms underlying the formation of post-infection sequelae are
complex and remain controversial. This hypothesis integrates Bystryn's antibody
feedback phenomenon and Imbiakha's immune cost theory, proposing for the first
time a "Consumption-Driven Dynamic Competition of Antibody Clones" mechanism.
This mechanism posits that the immune system may regulate the proliferation and
differentiation of corresponding B cell clones by sensing and responding to the
consumption rate of specific antibodies. This competition, driven by
differences in consumption rates, might not only influence pathogen clearance
efficiency and associated acute pathology during the antigen growth phase but
also critically mediate the onset, development, and even resolution of
post-infection sequelae during the antigen decay and homeostasis
re-establishment phases. The proposed three-phase "consumption-driven dynamic
competition" model provides a unified and dynamic explanatory framework for
understanding the significant individual variability and dynamic evolution of
post-infection immune outcomes (including the emergence and self-limitation of
acute symptoms, the formation and persistence of chronic sequelae, and symptom
fluctuations or resolution). It emphasizes not just specific molecules but the
macroscopic dynamics of competition and selection within the immune system,
offering a theoretical basis for exploring new intervention strategies for
sequelae (e.g., by regulating the balance of antibody competition).

### [2] [Novel software for continuous wavelet analysis enable EEG real-time analysis on portable computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07793)
*Shoichiro Nakanishi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于Python的连续小波变换（CWT）软件，适用于便携式计算机，实现了64电极EEG数据的实时分析，为轻量化脑机接口（BMI）设备提供了支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CWT在波形分析中广泛应用，但其计算复杂度高，难以在小型设备上实现实时分析。因此，需要一种适合轻量化计算机的快速计算方法。

Method: 开发了基于Python的CWT软件，并在便携式计算机上测试其性能，模拟了64电极EEG数据的实时分析。

Result: 软件在实时分析中表现出足够的速度，并能灵活调整CWT参数，适用于轻量化BMI设备。

Conclusion: 该软件为轻量化BMI设备的开发提供了支持，且CWT作为一种数学方法，还可用于其他用途。

Abstract: Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is frequently used for waveform analysis.
For example, in the field of neuroscience research, CWT is performed to analyze
electroencephalograms (EEG) and calculate the index of brain activity. Recent
advancements in computer technology, such as general-purpose computing on
Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), have enabled the application of CWT to
real-time waveform analysis. However, the computational complexity of CWT is
large, and it is challenging to employ CWT as a real-time analysis method, such
as in brain-machine interfaces (BMI), which require small size and cost.
Therefore, a fast calculation method suitable for small and lightweight
computers is desired. In this study, Python-based software for the CWT was
developed and tested on portable computers. Using this software, real-time
analysis of 64-electrode EEG data based on CWT was simulated and demonstrated
adequate speed for the real-time analysis. Furthermore, it exhibited
flexibility in performing CWT with various parameters. This software can
contribute to the development of compact and lightweight BMI devices. Since CWT
is a mathematical method, it may be used as a tool for other purposes.

### [3] [GTR-CoT: Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought for Molecular Structure Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07553)
*Jingchao Wang,Haote Yang,Jiang Wu,Yifan He,Xingjian Wei,Yinfan Wang,Chengjin Liu,Lingli Ge,Lijun Wu,Bin Wang,Dahua Lin,Conghui He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTR-Mol-VLM 是一种新型框架，通过图遍历和忠实识别机制改进光学化学结构识别（OCSR），在复杂分子结构和缩写标注上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂分子结构和不一致标注上的不足，提升化学知识数字化的准确性。

Method: 提出图遍历机制（Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought）和数据忠实性原则（Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen），并构建大规模数据集 GTR-CoT-1.3M 和基准 MolRec-Bench。

Result: GTR-Mol-VLM 在 SMILES 和图指标上均显著优于其他模型，尤其在功能组缩写场景中领先 14 个百分点。

Conclusion: 该工作有望推动 OCSR 技术更贴近实际需求，促进化学信息学和 AI for Science 的发展。

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing
chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable
formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in
this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex
molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}
mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular
graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric
principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses
the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded
annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a
large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,
and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained
evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist
models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in
scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,
GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage
points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work
will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby
advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release
GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

Motivation: 临床蛋白质组学领域需要高效的数据分析和假设生成以推动新发现，PROTEUS旨在通过自动化系统解决这一需求。

Method: PROTEUS采用模块化设计，模拟科学流程的不同阶段，从开放数据探索到统计分析及假设生成，并使用统一的图结构管理复杂研究过程。

Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces
data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical
proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis
proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate
modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended
data exploration to specific statistical analysis and hypothesis proposal. It
formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships
between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex
research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from
published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated
through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through
exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and
heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability
and novelty. In addition to accelerating multiomic analysis, PROTEUS represents
a path towards tailoring general autonomous systems to specialized scientific
domains to achieve open-ended hypothesis generation from data.

### [5] [ProteinZero: Self-Improving Protein Generation via Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07459)
*Ziwen Wang,Jiajun Fan,Ruihan Guo,Thao Nguyen,Heng Ji,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProteinZero通过在线强化学习框架提升蛋白质生成模型性能，显著降低设计失败率并提高多样性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质生成模型因高质量数据集稀缺而成功率受限，需一种可扩展的自动化改进方法。

Method: 引入基于ESM-fold和快速ddG预测的高效代理奖励模型，结合多奖励最大化、KL散度和序列多样性正则化。

Result: ProteinZero在结构准确性、可设计性、热力学稳定性和序列多样性上全面超越现有方法，失败率降低36%-48%。

Conclusion: ProteinZero为蛋白质设计提供了持续自我改进的新范式，扩展了设计空间探索的可能性。

Abstract: Protein generative models have shown remarkable promise in protein design but
still face limitations in success rate, due to the scarcity of high-quality
protein datasets for supervised pretraining. We present ProteinZero, a novel
framework that enables scalable, automated, and continuous self-improvement of
the inverse folding model through online reinforcement learning. To achieve
computationally tractable online feedback, we introduce efficient proxy reward
models based on ESM-fold and a novel rapid ddG predictor that significantly
accelerates evaluation speed. ProteinZero employs a general RL framework
balancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and
a novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode
collapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing
methods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant
improvements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability,
and sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure
rates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like
ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates
exceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL
run on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days,
including reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein
design where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs,
opening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space.

Abstract: Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory
chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and
reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to
the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough
understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever
transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200
process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our
experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process
conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on
solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically
and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking
for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering,
and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement
and sustainable manufacturing.

### [7] [On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06514)
*Viacheslav Dubovitskii,Aritra Bose,Filippo Utro,Laxmi Pardia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了量子随机游走（QRW）在生物分子网络分析中的潜力，相比经典随机游走，QRW在疾病相关基因排序和关键驱动基因识别上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物分子网络分析面临高维度、异质性和稀疏性等挑战，经典随机游走方法存在局限性，因此研究量子随机游走的潜力。

Method: 在基因-基因相互作用网络和细胞-细胞相互作用网络中，对比量子随机游走与经典随机游走的性能。

Result: 量子随机游走在疾病相关基因排序和关键驱动基因识别上表现优于经典方法。

Conclusion: 量子随机游走为网络医学和系统生物学提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene
associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the
complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to
understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying
therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high
dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk
algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules,
helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological
pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random
walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular
network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in
a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and
schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to
classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction
network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes
in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings
suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical
approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better
performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights
their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.
