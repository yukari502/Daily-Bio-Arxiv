Result: PaDEL、Mordred和RDKit描述符表现最佳，AutoML模型CaliciBoost的MAE性能最优，3D描述符使MAE降低15.73%。

Conclusion: AutoML方法在ADMET建模中效果显著，为数据有限的任务提供了实用的特征选择指导。

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

TL;DR: Protriever是一个端到端的可微分框架，用于检索同源蛋白质序列并同时训练目标任务，相比传统MSA方法更快且性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MSA的同源序列检索方法计算成本高，难以处理高度分化的序列或复杂的插入/删除模式，且与下游建模目标无关。

Method: Protriever通过端到端可微分框架，学习检索相关同源序列并同时训练目标任务，支持高效向量搜索。

Result: 在蛋白质适应性预测任务中，Protriever性能优于基于MSA的序列模型，且速度快两个数量级。

Conclusion: Protriever提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，适用于不同检索策略和蛋白质数据库。

Abstract: Retrieving homologous protein sequences is essential for a broad range of
protein modeling tasks such as fitness prediction, protein design, structure
modeling, and protein-protein interactions. Traditional workflows have relied
on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence
Alignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments.
However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with
highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and
operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce
Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve
relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When
applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog
retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector
search. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly
adapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time
-- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种多实验方程学习方法（ME-EQL），通过插值或统一模型库，显著提高了从ABM数据中恢复参数的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABM计算密集且难以解析，传统EQL方法需要大量模拟，泛化性不足。

Method: 提出OAT ME-EQL（逐个参数集学习并插值）和ES ME-EQL（跨参数统一模型库）。

Result: 两种方法显著降低参数恢复误差，OAT ME-EQL在参数空间泛化性更优。

Conclusion: ME-EQL提升了复杂生物系统模型的泛化性和可解释性。

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding
self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and
often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive
continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive
simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In
this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by
introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns
individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,
and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library
across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field
model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with
spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the
relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT
ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings
highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to
enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex
biological systems.

### [4] [Fuzzy permutation time irreversibility for nonequilibrium analysis of complex system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08058)
*Wenpo Yao*

Main category: physics.data-an

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种模糊排列时间不可逆性（fpTIR）方法，通过负指数函数测量向量元素的差异，改进了复杂系统非平衡特性的量化。同时引入模糊排列熵（fPEn）衡量系统复杂性，并在理论和实际数据（如心率）中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的排列时间不可逆性方法因粗粒度化无法准确表示时间结构的详细信息，因此需要一种更精确的方法来量化复杂系统的非平衡特性。

Method: 提出fpTIR方法，基于负指数函数计算向量元素的差异，构建幅度排列并计算其隶属度，测量前后向序列的概率分布差异。同时计算模糊排列熵（fPEn）以衡量系统复杂性。

Result: fpTIR能有效量化系统的非平衡特性，提高心率分析的准确性。但在混沌序列中，fpTIR与fPEn结果存在差异，甚至在心率分析中结果相反，其中fpTIR结果与衰老和疾病复杂性损失理论一致。

Conclusion: fpTIR能准确表征序列结构，提升复杂系统非平衡分析的精度，为非平衡动力学和熵复杂性研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Permutation time irreversibility is an important method to quantify
nonequilibrium characteristics of complex systems; however, ordinal pattern is
a coarse-graining alternative of temporal structure and cannot accurately
represent detailed structural information. This study aims to propose a fuzzy
permutation time irreversibility (fpTIR) by measuring the difference between
vector elements based on a negative exponential function. The amplitude
permutation of vector is constructed and its membership degree is calculated;
then, the difference in probability distribution between the forward and
backward sequences is measured for fpTIR. To compare and measure the system's
complexity, the Shannon entropy is calculated as the average amount of
information in the fuzzy permutation probability distribution, i.e., fuzzy
permutation entropy (fPEn). According to the surrogate theory, mode series are
generated using logistic, Henon, and first-order autoregressive systems to
verify the fpTIR, which is then used to analyze the heartbeats of patients with
congestive heart failure and healthy elderly and young participants from the
PhysioNet database. Results suggest that the fpTIR effectively measures the
system's nonequilibrium characteristics, thus improving the accuracy of
heartbeat analysis. However, in analyzing probability distributions, the fpTIR
and fPEn exhibit discrepancies in the chaotic series and even opposite results
in the heartbeats, wherein the results of fpTIR are consistent with the theory
of complexity loss in aging and disease. Overall, the fpTIR accurately
characterizes the structure of the sequences and enhances the accuracy of the
nonequilibrium analysis of complex systems, providing a theoretical basis for
exploring complex systems from the perspectives of nonequilibrium dynamics and
entropy complexity.
