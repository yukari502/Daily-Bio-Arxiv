### [1] [Localizing synergies of hidden factors across complex systems: resting brain networks and HeLa gene expression profile as case studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09053)
*Marlis Ontivero-Ortega,Gorana Mijatovic,Luca Faes,Daniele Marinazzo,Sebastiano Stramaglia*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，利用O信息量化潜在因子对观测变量的协同影响，并通过两个案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在因子对观测变量的影响通常是协同的，但传统因子分析未量化这种协同性。

Method: 使用O信息度量高维依赖关系，将潜在因子与观测变量联合分析。

Result: 在fMRI数据中发现DMN和FP网络协同性最高；在HeLa细胞中发现STK-12基因最具协同性。

Conclusion: 该方法为因子分析与高阶交互领域搭建了桥梁，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Factor analysis is a well-known statistical method to describe the
variability of observed variables in terms of a smaller number of unobserved
latent variables called factors. Even though latent factors are conceptually
independent of each other, their influence on the observed variables is often
joint and synergistic. We propose to quantify the synergy of the joint
influence of factors on the observed variables using the O-information, a
recently introduced metrics to assess high order dependencies in complex
systems, in a new framework where latent factors and observed variables are
jointly analyzed in terms of their joint informational character. Two case
studies are reported: analyzing resting fMRI data, we find that DMN and FP
networks show the highest synergy, consistently with their crucial role in
higher cognitive functions; concerning HeLa cells, we find that the most
synergistic gene is STK-12 (AURKB), suggesting that this gene is involved in
controlling the HeLa cell cycle. We believe that this approach, representing a
bridge between factor analysis and the field of high-order interactions, will
find wide application across several domains.

### [2] [Reconstructing Heterogeneous Biomolecules via Hierarchical Gaussian Mixtures and Part Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09063)
*Shayan Shekarforoush,David B. Lindell,Marcus A. Brubaker,David J. Fleet*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: CryoSPIRE是一种新型的3D重建框架，用于处理冷冻电镜图像中的非刚性构象灵活性和组成变异问题，通过分层高斯混合模型实现，并在CryoBench上达到最新技术水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜（Cryo-EM）在分子生物学中具有革命性意义，但如何建模非刚性构象灵活性和组成变异的分子结构仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于分层高斯混合模型的3D重建框架，通过部分分割粒子提供归纳偏置，以处理构象和组成变异。

Result: CryoSPIRE在复杂实验数据集上揭示了生物学意义的结构，并在CryoBench上实现了最新技术水平。

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE为冷冻电镜图像中的结构建模提供了有效解决方案，特别是在处理非刚性和组成变异方面表现优异。

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

### [3] [Detecting malignant dynamics on very few blood sample using signature coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09097)
*Rémi Vaucher,Stéphane Chrétien*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 利用循环肿瘤DNA（ctDNA）和签名理论，提出了一种基于血液样本检测侵袭性癌症肿瘤的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ctDNA在癌症监测中具有潜力，但数据稀疏性是一个挑战。签名理论作为特征提取工具，可以解决这一问题。

Method: 结合连续时间马尔可夫模型和签名理论，分析ctDNA动态变化，构建高效检测流程。

Result: 数值实验验证了方法的有效性，能够克服数据稀疏性。

Conclusion: 该方法为早期多癌症检测提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent discoveries have suggested that the promising avenue of using
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in blood samples provides reasonable
accuracy for cancer monitoring, with extremely low burden on the patient's
side. It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms
leading to DNA release from cells, such as apoptosis, necrosis or active
secretion. One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring
the dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer
detection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g.
in the company named GRAIL.
  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for
detecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our
approach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics
of ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient
testing procedures. Signature theory is a topic of growing interest in the
Machine Learning community (see Chevyrev2016 and Fermanian2021), which is now
recognised as a powerful feature extraction tool for irregularly sampled
signals. The method proposed in the present paper is shown to correctly address
the challenging problem of overcoming the inherent data scarsity due to the
extremely small number of blood samples per patient. The relevance of our
approach is illustrated with extensive numerical experiments that confirm the
efficiency of the proposed pipeline.

### [4] [Simulation-trained conditional normalizing flows for likelihood approximation: a case study in stress regulation kinetics in yeast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09374)
*Pedro Pessoa,Juan Andres Martinez,Vincent Vandenbroucke,Frank Delvigne,Steve Pressé*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用条件归一化流（一种神经网络模型）来近似难以处理的似然函数的方法，以解决细胞分裂历史依赖性问题，并在酵母菌的glc3基因激活研究中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多模型虽然概念简单，但由于历史依赖性（如细胞分裂导致蛋白质分配的非马尔可夫性），无法直接构建似然函数。这限制了参数估计和贝叶斯推断的应用。

Method: 采用条件归一化流（神经网络模型）从模拟数据中学习概率分布，以近似难以处理的似然函数。

Result: 在酵母菌glc3基因研究中，传统方法忽略细胞分裂会误判基因活性，而新方法通过考虑细胞分裂的非马尔可夫效应，发现glc3在压力下多为非活跃状态，表达短暂且瞬时。

Conclusion: 条件归一化流为处理历史依赖性问题提供了一种有效工具，揭示了传统分析方法的局限性，并改进了对基因表达动态的理解。

Abstract: Physics-inspired inference often hinges on the ability to construct a
likelihood, or the probability of observing a sequence of data given a model.
These likelihoods can be directly maximized for parameter estimation,
incorporated into Bayesian frameworks, or even used as loss functions in neural
networks. Yet, many models, despite being conceptually simple, lack tractable
likelihoods. A notable example arises in estimating protein production from
snapshot measurements of actively dividing cells. Here, the challenge stems
from cell divisions occurring at non-Exponentially distributed intervals with
each division stochastically partitioning protein content between daughter
cells, making protein counts in any given cell a function of its full division
history. Such history dependence precludes a straightforward likelihood based
on a (standard Markovian) master equation. Instead, we employ conditional
normalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn
probability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods
from simulated data. As a case study, we examine activation of the \emph{glc3}
gene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under
nutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot
fluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects
\emph{glc3} promoter activity. A na\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data
ignoring cell division suggests many cells are active with low expression.
However, fluorescent proteins persist and can be inherited, so cells may appear
active from retaining ancestral fluorescence. Explicitly accounting for the
(non-Markovian) effects of cell division reveals \emph{glc3} is mostly inactive
under stress, showing that while cells occasionally activate it, expression is
brief and transient.

### [5] [Geometry Reduced Order Modeling (GROM) with application to modeling of glymphatic function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09442)
*Andreas Solheim,Geir Ringstand,Per Kristian Eide,Kent-Andre Mardal*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出一种利用模型降阶技术和图像配准方法降低脑几何计算模型计算成本的新方法，并在101例患者MRI数据上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法难以实现大规模患者特异性脑代谢废物清除的计算建模，需降低计算成本。

Method: 结合模型降阶技术和基于MRI的图像配准方法，将已有解映射到新几何结构上。

Result: 在101例患者MRI数据中验证了方法的有效性，包括正常人和特发性正常压力脑积水患者。

Conclusion: 该方法可显著降低计算成本，适用于不同脑几何结构，包括病理情况。

Abstract: Computational modeling of the brain has become a key part of understanding
how the brain clears metabolic waste, but patient-specific modeling on a
significant scale is still out of reach with current methods. We introduce a
novel approach for leveraging model order reduction techniques in computational
models of brain geometries to alleviate computational costs involved in
numerical simulations. Using image registration methods based on magnetic
resonance imaging, we compute inter-brain mappings which allow previously
computed solutions on other geometries to be mapped on to a new geometry. We
investigate this approach on two example problems typical of modeling of
glymphatic function, applied to a dataset of 101 MRI of human patients. We
discuss the applicability of the method when applied to a patient with no known
neurological disease, as well as a patient diagnosed with idiopathic Normal
Pressure Hydrocephalus displaying significantly enlarged ventricles

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗菌素耐药性是一个全球性健康问题，需要更快速的检测方法。

Abstract: Purpose: Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern, affecting
hospital admissions and treatment success. This study aims to introduce an
experimental setup for monitoring bacterial activity over time using
image-based contrast as a key biomarker. Methods: The proposed method captures
changes in bacterial activity by analyzing variations in image contrast. The
approach is evaluated for its ability to detect antimicrobial effects over
shorter time intervals compared to conventional clinical techniques. Results:
The findings reveal a progressive decrease in contrast over time, suggesting
its potential as an indicator of antimicrobial activity. The results highlight
the method's capability for early detection of bacterial susceptibility.
Conclusion: The study demonstrates that image-based contrast analysis can serve
as a rapid and reliable tool for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, offering
advantages over traditional methods in clinical practice.

### [7] [Data-Driven Modeling of IRCU Patient Flow in the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09751)
*Ana Carmen Navas-Ortega,José Antonio Sánchez-Martínez,Paula García-Flores,Concepción Morales-García,Rene Fabregas*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 研究评估了西班牙新建的中级呼吸护理单元（IRCU）在COVID-19期间的临床效果和运营动态，发现其通过专业人员和动态模型有效管理了重症患者，减轻了ICU压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估IRCU在COVID-19危机中对呼吸衰竭患者的临床效果和运营效率，为类似单位在疫情中的部署提供依据。

Method: 采用前瞻性队列研究（249例患者）和两种模型（ODE状态转移模型和基于LOS的随机卷积模型）分析患者流动和临床结果。

Result: IRCU成功管理了重症患者，非NIV患者无ICU转移或死亡，NIV患者68%在IRCU康复；模型显示系统在高峰期受压但可通过效率改进缓解。

Conclusion: 配备专业人员的IRCU在COVID-19中表现良好，动态模型证实其有效性并支持在疫情中推广此类单位。

Abstract: Intermediate Respiratory Care Units (IRCUs) are vital during crises like
COVID-19. This study evaluated clinical outcomes and operational dynamics of a
new Spanish IRCU with specialized staffing. A prospective cohort study
(April-August 2021) included 249 adult patients with COVID-19 respiratory
failure (UHVN IRCU, Granada). Data on demographics, Non-Invasive Ventilation
(NIV), length of stay (LOS), and outcomes (ICU transfer, exitus, recovery) were
analyzed. Patient flow was simulated using a data-calibrated deterministic
compartmental model (Ordinary Differential Equations, ODEs) that represented
state transitions, and an empirical LOS-based stochastic convolution model that
incorporated admission variability. The median age was 51; 31% of patients
required NIV. NIV patients were older (median 61 vs 42, p<0.001). Overall, 8%
needed ICU transfer; 3% experienced in-IRCU exitus. Notably, no ICU transfers
or deaths occurred among 172 non-NIV patients. Of 77 high-risk NIV patients,
68% recovered in IRCU without ICU escalation. The ODE model, based on
transition rates between patient states, reflected aggregate outcomes. Both
modeling approaches demonstrated system strain during admission surges
(partially mitigated by simulated care efficiency improvements via parameter
modulation) and yielded consistent peak occupancy estimates. This IRCU, with
specialized staffing, effectively managed severe COVID-19. High recovery rates,
especially for NIV patients, potentially eased ICU pressure. Dynamic modeling
confirmed surge vulnerability but highlighted the benefits of care efficiency
from modulated transition parameters. Findings underscore positive outcomes in
this IRCU model and support such units in pandemic response.

### [8] [Branched Schrödinger Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09007)
*Sophia Tang,Yinuo Zhang,Alexander Tong,Pranam Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BranchSBM的新框架，用于学习分支的Schrödinger桥，解决了现有方法无法捕捉多路径演化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如流匹配和Schrödinger桥匹配）只能建模单一路径，无法处理从共同起源到多个不同结果的分支演化。

Method: BranchSBM通过参数化多个时间依赖的速度场和增长过程，实现了对多终端分布的分支演化建模。

Result: BranchSBM不仅更具表达力，而且在多路径导航、细胞命运分化和细胞响应模拟等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: BranchSBM为多路径演化问题提供了有效的解决方案，扩展了生成建模的能力。

Abstract: Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target
distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches,
such as flow matching and Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn
mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path.
However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and
cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple
distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr\"odinger Bridge
Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr\"odinger
bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and
growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence
into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more
expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface
navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states,
and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.

### [9] [Llama-Affinity: A Predictive Antibody Antigen Binding Model Integrating Antibody Sequences with Llama3 Backbone Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09052)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Llama 3的抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测模型（LlamaAffinity），在多个评估指标上优于现有方法，并显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗体亲和力测量方法耗时且昂贵，AI技术的发展为抗体设计和亲和力预测提供了新途径。

Method: 利用开源Llama 3框架和OAS数据库中的抗体序列数据，开发了LlamaAffinity模型。

Result: 模型在准确率（0.9640）、F1分数（0.9643）、精确率（0.9702）、召回率（0.9586）和AUC-ROC（0.9936）上表现优异，训练时间显著缩短。

Conclusion: LlamaAffinity模型在抗体-抗原亲和力预测中具有高效性和优越性，为AI驱动的抗体设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense
against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of
antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for
maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements
have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These
antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating
cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been
time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in
silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine
learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing
antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved
affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding
affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3
backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space
(OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy)
across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an
accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of
0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher
computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of
only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

### [10] [Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09167)
*James R. Williamson,Andrew Alini,Brian A. Telfer,Adam W. Potter,Karl E. Friedl*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了内脏脂肪组织（VAT）与日常体力活动（PA）的关系，并通过两种方法从PA数据中估计VAT，最终结合两种方法得到高精度结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAT是代谢健康和PA的关键指标，过量VAT与2型糖尿病和胰岛素抵抗高度相关。研究旨在探索PA与VAT的关系，以评估代谢健康风险。

Method: 使用NHANES数据，采用两种方法估计VAT：1）基于步态和睡眠运动的特征工程与岭回归；2）基于深度神经网络和Transformer模型的连续加速度计数据分析。

Result: 结合两种方法后，VAT估计的相关系数达到r=0.86，表明PA与VAT及代谢健康风险之间存在强关联。

Conclusion: 研究证实PA与VAT及代谢健康风险密切相关，为通过PA评估代谢健康提供了新方法。

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and
habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2
diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology
relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile
fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during
exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can
also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for
individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;
2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.
The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,
and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a
VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours
of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame
into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each
day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over
multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained
with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body
measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two
approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by
extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.
