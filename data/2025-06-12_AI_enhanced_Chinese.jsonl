VAT is also a highly labile\nfat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during\nexercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can\nalso be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for\nindividuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;\n2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.\nThe first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,\nand then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a\nVAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours\nof continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame\ninto a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each\nday's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over\nmultiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained\nwith the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body\nmeasurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two\napproaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These\nfindings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by\nextension, between PA and metabolic health risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5185\u810f\u8102\u80aa\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08VAT\uff09\u4e0e\u65e5\u5e38\u4f53\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08PA\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecePA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1VAT\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "VAT\u662f\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\u548cPA\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fc7\u91cfVAT\u4e0e2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u548c\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u62b5\u6297\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22PA\u4e0eVAT\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NHANES\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1VAT\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b65\u6001\u548c\u7761\u7720\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u540e\uff0cVAT\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8fbe\u5230r=0.86\uff0c\u8868\u660ePA\u4e0eVAT\u53ca\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9ePA\u4e0eVAT\u53ca\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7PA\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
