### [1] [Predicting function of evolutionarily implausible DNA sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10271)
*Shiyu Jiang,Xuyin Liu,Zitong Jerry Wang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出Nullsettes任务集，评估基因组语言模型预测功能突变的能力，发现模型性能与序列长度和突变前序列的预测似然密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组语言模型在合成生物学中生成功能性DNA序列的潜力，但需学习序列与功能关系。

Method: 引入Nullsettes任务集，评估12个先进模型预测功能突变的能力。

Result: 突变效应预测性能与未突变序列的预测似然强相关，且性能范围高度依赖序列长度。

Conclusion: 使用基因组语言模型预测突变效应时，需同时考虑序列似然和序列长度。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

*Olga Ovcharenko,Florian Barkmann,Philip Toma,Imant Daunhawer,Julia Vogt,Sebastian Schelter,Valentina Boeva*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: scSSL-Bench是一个评估19种自监督学习方法在单细胞数据上表现的基准测试，涵盖9个数据集和3个下游任务，揭示了任务特定的性能差异和最佳数据增强策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动自监督学习在单细胞数据中的应用，填补现有研究在系统性评估和任务特定性能差异上的空白。

Method: 通过scSSL-Bench基准测试，评估19种自监督学习方法在9个数据集上的表现，重点关注批处理校正、细胞类型注释和多模态数据预测三个任务，并系统分析数据增强策略。

Result: 专用单细胞框架（如scVI、CLAIRE和scGPT）在批处理校正中表现优异，而通用自监督方法（如VICReg和SimCLR）在细胞类型注释和多模态数据整合中更优；随机掩码是最有效的数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门针对单细胞多模态数据整合的框架，scSSL-Bench为自监督学习在单细胞分析中的应用提供了标准化评估平台和具体建议。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

### [3] [Evaluating interventions for Plasmodium vivax forest malaria using a three-scale mathematical model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10040)
*Shoshana Elgart,Mark B. Flegg,Jennifer A. Flegg*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文研究了针对森林边缘地区间日疟原虫传播的最佳干预措施，通过数学模型评估了药物和蚊虫控制技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间日疟原虫病例在湄公河次区域森林边缘地区比例上升，需针对森林活动人群的干预措施。

Method: 扩展了已有的三尺度积分微分方程模型，拟合越南四年数据，评估大规模药物管理和蚊虫控制技术。

Result: 模型验证了流行病学趋势，显示最佳药物管理时间依赖人口特征，蚊虫叮咬率干预和针对休眠体的药物效果关键。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对森林活动人群的干预措施需结合人口特征和药物效果，以优化疟疾控制策略。

Abstract: The rising proportion of Plasmodium vivax cases concentrated in forest-fringe
areas across the Greater Mekong Subregion highlights the importance of
pharmaceutical and mosquito control techniques specifically targeted towards
forest-going populations. To mathematically assess best-possible antimalarial
interventions in the context of hypnozoite reactivation and seasonal forest
migration, we extend a previously developed three-scale integro-differential
equations model of P. vivax transmission. In particular, we fit the model to
data gathered over a four-year period in Vietnam to gain insight into local P.
vivax dynamics and validate the model's ability to capture epidemiological
trends. The calibrated model is then used to generate optimal schedules for
mass-drug administration (MDA) in forest-goers and gauge the efficacy of vector
control techniques (such as long-lasting insecticide nets and indoor residual
spraying) in forest-adjacent areas. Our results highlight the dependence of
optimal MDA timing on the demographics of the human population, the importance
of interventions targeting the mosquito bite rate, and the need for efficacy in
hypnozoite-targeting antimalarial drugs.

### [4] [FAPS: A Fast Platform for Protein Structureomics Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10134)
*Lucas Wilken,Nihjum Paul,Troy Timmerman,Sara A. Tolba,Amara Arshad,Di Wu,Wenjie Xia,Bakhtiyor Rasulev,Rick Jansen,Dali Sun*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: FAPS数据库是一个用于快速分析蛋白质结构的平台，将大规模结构组学分析时间从几周缩短到几秒，填补了现有工具在结构信息分析上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质定量和分析方法缺乏结构信息，而结构组学分析工具不足，限制了大规模生物分子结构研究的进展。

Method: 开发了FAPS数据库，整合了SWISS-MODEL、AlphaFold的模拟数据和UniProt数据库的实验数据，提供用户友好的蛋白质二级结构分析功能。

Result: FAPS显著提高了结构组学分析的效率，支持快速数值和可视化参考，为蛋白质结构计算和分析提供了便捷工具。

Conclusion: FAPS填补了结构组学分析工具的空白，为生物标志物发现和蛋白质研究提供了高效、集中的数据平台。

Abstract: Protein quantification and analysis are well-accepted approaches for
biomarker discovery but are limited to identification without structural
information. High-throughput omics data (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, and
proteomics) have become pervasive in cancer biology studies and reach well
beyond more specialized areas such as metabolomics, epigenomics,
pharmacogenomics, and interact-omics. However, large-scale analysis based on
the structure of the biomolecules, namely structure-omics, is still
underexplored due to a lack of handy tools. In response, we developed the Fast
Analysis of Protein Structure (FAPS) database, a platform designed to advance
quantitative proteomics to structure-omics analysis, which significantly
shortens large-scale structure-omics from weeks to seconds. FAPS can serve as a
new protein secondary structure database, providing a centralized and
functional database for both simulated and experimentally determined
bioinformatics statistics relating to secondary structure. Stored data is
generated both through the structure simulation, currently SWISS-MODEL and
AlphaFold, performed by high-performance computers, and the pre-existing
UniProt database. FAPS provides user-friendly features that create a
straightforward and effective way of accessing accurate data on the proportion
of secondary structure in different protein chains, providing a fast numerical
and visual reference for protein structure calculations and analysis. FAPS is
accessible through http://fapsdb.org.

### [5] [A Goemans-Williamson type algorithm for identifying subcohorts in clinical trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10879)
*Pratik Worah*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，用于从大型非均匀数据集中识别同质子集（子队列），理论贡献为近似优化问题的0.82因子舍入技术，应用于乳腺癌RNA微阵列数据，识别转移病例为主的子队列，并发现甲基化水平与核受体表达变化的统计显著关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非均匀数据集中识别同质子集有助于发现疾病通路和治疗方法，尤其是针对特定子队列的个性化医疗。

Method: 设计了一种基于线性分类器的高效算法，采用类似Goemans和Williamson（1994）的舍入技术，近似优化问题的最优解。

Result: 算法在乳腺癌数据中成功识别转移病例为主的子队列，并发现甲基化水平与核受体表达变化的统计显著关联。

Conclusion: 该算法为识别同质子集提供了高效工具，有助于疾病研究和个性化治疗开发。

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

### [7] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过机器学习方法（XGBoost）和可解释性技术（SHAP）分析阿尔茨海默病（AD）相关特征，强调相关性不等于因果性，为未来因果推断研究奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AD研究中，区分因果关系和相关关系对诊断、治疗和疾病驱动因素的识别至关重要。

Method: 结合相关性分析、机器学习分类（XGBoost）和模型可解释性技术（SHAP），分析临床、认知、遗传和生物标志物特征。

Result: 发现认知评分和遗传风险因素是AD分类的关键特征，相关性矩阵揭示了变量间的关联，SHAP值提供了特征贡献的详细解释。

Conclusion: 研究强调相关性不等于因果性，需谨慎解释关联数据，为未来因果推断研究和AD早期诊断及干预提供基础。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [8] [MARS: Processing-In-Memory Acceleration of Raw Signal Genome Analysis Inside the Storage Subsystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10931)
*Melina Soysal,Konstantina Koliogeorgi,Can Firtina,Nika Mansouri Ghiasi,Rakesh Nadig,Haiyu Mayo,Geraldo F. Oliveira,Yu Liang,Klea Zambaku,Mohammad Sadrosadati,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MARS是一种基于存储中心的系统，通过硬件/软件协同设计加速原始信号基因组分析（RSGA），解决了数据移动和计算瓶颈，显著提升了性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着测序技术的快速发展，软件基础的RSGA难以匹配原始信号生成的高吞吐量，数据移动成为性能和能耗的主要瓶颈。

Method: MARS通过修改RSGA管道（引入过滤机制和量化方案）、利用存储内部资源（如DRAM、控制器、闪存芯片）以及采用处理近内存和处理用内存范式，优化执行步骤并减少数据移动。

Result: MARS在性能上分别比软件基础和硬件加速的最新读映射流程快93倍和40倍，能耗降低427倍和72倍。

Conclusion: MARS通过存储中心的设计，高效解决了RSGA的数据移动和计算瓶颈，为实时基因组分析提供了高性能和低能耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to
enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals.
However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly
difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal
generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques
can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the
performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As
sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to
both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a
high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the
data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We
propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous
resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage
controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both
data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and
low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software
co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering
mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing
for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly
within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and
Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of
all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement.
Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and
hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on
average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by
427x and 72x.
