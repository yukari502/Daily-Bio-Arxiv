### [1] [Predicting function of evolutionarily implausible DNA sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10271)
*Shiyu Jiang,Xuyin Liu,Zitong Jerry Wang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文研究了基因组语言模型（gLM）在预测功能突变中的表现，发现模型性能与序列长度和序列似然密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索gLM如何通过学习序列与功能关系来生成功能性DNA序列，并评估其在预测突变效应中的表现。

Method: 引入Nullsettes任务集，评估12种先进模型在预测功能突变中的能力，分析序列似然和长度的影响。

Result: 模型性能与序列似然强相关，且预测性能的范围高度依赖序列长度。

Conclusion: 使用gLM进行突变效应预测时，需同时考虑序列似然和长度。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

### [2] [scSSL-Bench: Benchmarking Self-Supervised Learning for Single-Cell Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10031)
*Olga Ovcharenko,Florian Barkmann,Philip Toma,Imant Daunhawer,Julia Vogt,Sebastian Schelter,Valentina Boeva*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: scSSL-Bench是一个评估19种自监督学习方法在单细胞数据上的综合基准测试，涵盖9个数据集和3个下游任务，揭示了任务特定的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动对自监督学习在单细胞数据中应用的理解，并为方法选择提供指导。

Method: 通过评估19种自监督学习方法在9个数据集上的表现，重点关注批处理校正、细胞类型注释和缺失模态预测三个任务，并系统评估数据增强策略。

Result: 专用单细胞框架（如scVI、CLAIRE和scGPT）在批处理校正中表现优异，而通用自监督方法（如VICReg和SimCLR）在细胞类型注释和多模态数据整合中更优。随机掩码是最有效的数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门针对单细胞多模态数据整合的框架，scSSL-Bench为单细胞分析中的自监督学习应用提供了标准化评估平台和建议。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

### [3] [Evaluating interventions for Plasmodium vivax forest malaria using a three-scale mathematical model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10040)
*Shoshana Elgart,Mark B. Flegg,Jennifer A. Flegg*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该论文研究了针对森林边缘地区疟疾传播的最佳干预措施，通过数学模型评估了大规模药物管理（MDA）和蚊虫控制技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大湄公河次区域森林边缘地区间日疟原虫病例增加，需针对该人群设计有效的药物和蚊虫控制干预措施。

Method: 扩展了一个三尺度积分微分方程模型，拟合越南四年数据，评估MDA和蚊虫控制技术（如长效杀虫蚊帐和室内滞留喷洒）的效果。

Result: 结果表明，最佳MDA时间取决于人口结构，蚊虫叮咬率干预措施至关重要，且需有效针对休眠体（hypnozoite）的抗疟药物。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对森林边缘人群的精准干预措施的重要性，尤其是结合药物和蚊虫控制策略。

Abstract: The rising proportion of Plasmodium vivax cases concentrated in forest-fringe
areas across the Greater Mekong Subregion highlights the importance of
pharmaceutical and mosquito control techniques specifically targeted towards
forest-going populations. To mathematically assess best-possible antimalarial
interventions in the context of hypnozoite reactivation and seasonal forest
migration, we extend a previously developed three-scale integro-differential
equations model of P. vivax transmission. In particular, we fit the model to
data gathered over a four-year period in Vietnam to gain insight into local P.
vivax dynamics and validate the model's ability to capture epidemiological
trends. The calibrated model is then used to generate optimal schedules for
mass-drug administration (MDA) in forest-goers and gauge the efficacy of vector
control techniques (such as long-lasting insecticide nets and indoor residual
spraying) in forest-adjacent areas. Our results highlight the dependence of
optimal MDA timing on the demographics of the human population, the importance
of interventions targeting the mosquito bite rate, and the need for efficacy in
hypnozoite-targeting antimalarial drugs.

### [4] [FAPS: A Fast Platform for Protein Structureomics Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10134)
*Lucas Wilken,Nihjum Paul,Troy Timmerman,Sara A. Tolba,Amara Arshad,Di Wu,Wenjie Xia,Bakhtiyor Rasulev,Rick Jansen,Dali Sun*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了FAPS数据库，将蛋白质结构分析从几周缩短到几秒，支持大规模结构组学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质定量分析缺乏结构信息，且结构组学工具不足，限制了研究进展。

Method: 结合SWISS-MODEL、AlphaFold和UniProt数据库，开发了FAPS平台，提供蛋白质二级结构的快速分析和可视化。

Result: FAPS显著提升了结构组学分析效率，支持模拟和实验数据的集中访问。

Conclusion: FAPS为蛋白质结构研究提供了高效工具，填补了结构组学领域的空白。

Abstract: Protein quantification and analysis are well-accepted approaches for
biomarker discovery but are limited to identification without structural
information. High-throughput omics data (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, and
proteomics) have become pervasive in cancer biology studies and reach well
beyond more specialized areas such as metabolomics, epigenomics,
pharmacogenomics, and interact-omics. However, large-scale analysis based on
the structure of the biomolecules, namely structure-omics, is still
underexplored due to a lack of handy tools. In response, we developed the Fast
Analysis of Protein Structure (FAPS) database, a platform designed to advance
quantitative proteomics to structure-omics analysis, which significantly
shortens large-scale structure-omics from weeks to seconds. FAPS can serve as a
new protein secondary structure database, providing a centralized and
functional database for both simulated and experimentally determined
bioinformatics statistics relating to secondary structure. Stored data is
generated both through the structure simulation, currently SWISS-MODEL and
AlphaFold, performed by high-performance computers, and the pre-existing
UniProt database. FAPS provides user-friendly features that create a
straightforward and effective way of accessing accurate data on the proportion
of secondary structure in different protein chains, providing a fast numerical
and visual reference for protein structure calculations and analysis. FAPS is
accessible through http://fapsdb.org.

### [5] [A Goemans-Williamson type algorithm for identifying subcohorts in clinical trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10879)
*Pratik Worah*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，用于从大型非均匀数据集中识别同质子集，理论贡献为近似优化问题的0.82因子舍入技术，应用于乳腺癌RNA数据识别同质子集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非均匀数据中识别同质子集有助于发现特定子集的疾病通路和治疗方法。

Method: 设计线性分类器算法，采用类似Goemans和Williamson的舍入技术近似优化问题。

Result: 算法成功识别乳腺癌RNA数据中的同质子集，并发现甲基化水平与核受体表达变化的统计显著关联。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效识别同质子集，对疾病研究和治疗有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

### [7] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合相关性分析、机器学习分类和模型可解释性技术，探讨了阿尔茨海默病（AD）中临床、认知、遗传和生物标志物特征的关系，强调相关性不等于因果性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解因果关系与相关性的区别对AD研究至关重要，影响诊断、治疗和疾病驱动因素的识别。

Method: 使用XGBoost算法和SHAP值分析特征重要性，结合相关性矩阵和模型可解释性技术。

Result: 发现认知评分和遗传风险因素是AD分类的关键特征，但强相关性不意味着因果关系。

Conclusion: 区分因果因素与相关标志物有助于改进AD的早期诊断和靶向干预，为未来因果推断研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [8] [MARS: Processing-In-Memory Acceleration of Raw Signal Genome Analysis Inside the Storage Subsystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10931)

TL;DR: MARS是一个存储中心系统，通过硬件/软件协同设计加速原始信号基因组分析（RSGA），解决数据移动和计算瓶颈，显著提升性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着测序技术的快速发展，软件基础的RSGA难以匹配原始信号生成的高吞吐量，数据移动成为性能和能耗的主要瓶颈。

Method: MARS采用存储内计算范式，结合过滤机制和量化方案优化RSGA流程，利用存储内异构资源加速计算。

Result: MARS在性能和能效上显著优于现有软件和硬件加速方案，平均加速93倍和40倍，能耗降低427倍和72倍。

Conclusion: MARS通过存储中心设计有效解决了RSGA的数据移动和计算瓶颈，为高性能、高能效的基因组分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to
enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals.
However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly
difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal
generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques
can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the
performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As
sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to
both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a
high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the
data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We
propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous
resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage
controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both
data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and
low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software
co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering
mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing
for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly
within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and
Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of
all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement.
Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and
hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on
average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by
427x and 72x.
