This requires that the models are practically\nidentifiable, that is, the values of the parameters can be confidently\ndetermined, given available data. A well-designed experiment can produce data\nthat are much more informative for the purpose of inferring parameter values\nthan a poorly designed experiment. It is, therefore, of great interest to\noptimally design experiments such that the resulting data maximise the\npractical identifiability of a chosen model. Experimental design is also useful\nfor model discrimination, where we seek to distinguish between multiple\ndistinct, competing models of the same biological system in order to determine\nwhich model better reveals insight into the underlying biological mechanisms.\nIn many cases, an external stimulus can be used as a control input to probe the\nbehaviour of the system. In this paper, we will explore techniques for\noptimally designing such a control for a given experiment, in order to maximise\nparameter identifiability and model discrimination, and demonstrate these\ntechniques in the context of commonly applied ordinary differential equation\nmodels. We use a profile likelihood-based approach to assess parameter\nidentifiability. We then show how the problem of optimal experimental design\nfor model discrimination can be formulated as an optimal control problem, which\ncan be solved efficiently by applying Pontryagin's Maximum Principle."}

Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent\nSO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A\nnon-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned\nrepresentations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs\nsignificantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models.

With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the\npromise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both\nspatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models\neither ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene\nregulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from\nneighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with\nhierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create\ncontextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics\ndata, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation\nmodel for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as\nspatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a\ngene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph\ntransformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing\nwithin levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15\norgans using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding\nobjectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that\nit effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,\nenabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models\nfail to differentiate.

In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and\nexplore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the\nposterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common\napproach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation\nitself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and\nlow-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is\nmodeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a\nlower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy\nbetween the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its\ndistribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the\napproximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the\nlikelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of\nthe above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions\nderived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and\ncomputational cost.
