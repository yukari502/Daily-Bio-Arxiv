### [1] [Improving spliced alignment by modeling splice sites with deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12986)
*Siying Yang,Neng Huang,Heng Li*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: minisplice利用1D-CNN学习剪接信号，显著提升了长读RNA-seq和远源蛋白质的比对准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪接比对在基因注释和功能研究中至关重要，但现有比对工具使用简单模型，可能影响准确性。

Method: 使用一维卷积神经网络（1D-CNN）训练模型，捕捉跨物种保守的剪接信号，并计算基因组中每个GT和AG的剪接概率。

Result: 在人类长读RNA-seq和跨物种蛋白质数据上验证，显著提高了剪接位点的准确性。

Conclusion: minisplice通过改进剪接信号建模，提升了比对工具的性能。

Abstract: Motivation: Spliced alignment refers to the alignment of messenger RNA (mRNA)
or protein sequences to eukaryotic genomes. It plays a critical role in gene
annotation and the study of gene functions. Accurate spliced alignment demands
sophisticated modeling of splice sites, but current aligners use simple models,
which may affect their accuracy given dissimilar sequences.
  Results: We implemented minisplice to learn splice signals with a
one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and trained a model with
7,026 parameters for vertebrate and insect genomes. It captures conserved
splice signals across phyla and reveals GC-rich introns specific to mammals and
birds. We used this model to estimate the empirical splicing probability for
every GT and AG in genomes, and modified minimap2 and miniprot to leverage
pre-computed splicing probability during alignment. Evaluation on human
long-read RNA-seq data and cross-species protein datasets showed our method
greatly improves the junction accuracy especially for noisy long RNA-seq reads
and proteins of distant homology.

### [2] [Nucleation feedback can drive establishment and maintenance of biased microtubule polarity in neurites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12209)
*Hannah G. Scanlon,Gibarni Mahata,Anna C. Nelson,Scott A. McKinley,Melissa M. Rolls,Maria-Veronica Ciocanel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种空间显式随机模型，研究微管阵列中新生微管如何在线性域中产生偏向极性，发现核化反馈机制足以在不同长度的神经突中建立偏向极性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微管阵列如何在细胞生命周期中维持偏向极性或响应损伤重新排列极性，特别是针对神经突中的细胞骨架组织。

Method: 使用连续时间马尔可夫链模型模拟微管生长动态，参数化两种实验验证的核化机制：核化反馈和检查点机制。

Result: 核化反馈机制足以在不同长度的神经突中建立偏向极性，且这种偏向极性的出现和维持对随机波动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型为研究微管核化与极性关系提供了框架，并可扩展到其他生物环境中极化纤维阵列的形成机制。

Abstract: The microtubule cytoskeleton is comprised of dynamic, polarized filaments
that facilitate transport within the cell. Polarized microtubule arrays are key
to facilitating cargo transport in long cells such as neurons. Microtubules
also undergo dynamic instability, where the plus and minus ends of the
filaments switch between growth and shrinking phases, leading to frequent
microtubule turnover. Although microtubules often completely disassemble and
new filaments nucleate, microtubule arrays have been observed to both maintain
their biased orientation throughout the cell lifetime and to rearrange their
polarity as an adaptive response to injury. Motivated by cytoskeleton
organization in neurites, we propose a spatially-explicit stochastic model of
microtubule arrays and investigate how nucleation of new filaments could
generate biased polarity in a simple linear domain. Using a continuous-time
Markov chain model of microtubule growth dynamics, we model and parameterize
two experimentally-validated nucleation mechanisms: nucleation feedback, where
the direction of filament growth depends on existing microtubule content, and a
checkpoint mechanism, where microtubules that nucleate in a direction opposite
to the majority experience frequent catastrophe. When incorporating these
validated mechanisms into the spatial model, we find that nucleation feedback
is sufficient to establish biased polarity in neurites of different lengths,
and that the emergence and maintenance of biased polarity is robust in spite of
stochastic fluctuations. This work provides a framework to study the
relationship between microtubule nucleation and polarity, and could extend to
give insights into mechanisms that drive the formation of polarized filament
arrays in other biological settings.

### [3] [Evaluation of machine-learning models to measure individualized treatment effects from randomized clinical trial data with time-to-event outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12277)
*Elvire Roblin,Paul-Henry Cournède,Stefan Michiels*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在随机临床试验中，利用灵活的机器学习模型（如神经网络和随机生存森林）评估个体化治疗推荐的价值，尤其是在处理高维数据和非线性效应时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估机器学习模型在随机临床试验中处理高维数据和非线性效应的能力，以提供更准确的个体化治疗推荐。

Method: 方法包括比较基于神经网络的生存模型（CoxCC和CoxTime）、随机生存森林（Interaction Forests）和带有自适应LASSO惩罚的Cox模型。使用特定指标（如C-for-Benefit、E50-for-Benefit和RMSE）评估性能，并通过模拟研究和乳腺癌数据集验证。

Result: 结果显示，机器学习方法在模拟数据集中表现良好，尤其是随机生存森林在区分能力和神经网络在校准方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 结论表明，当存在非线性和交互效应时，机器学习方法可用于评估随机试验中的个体化治疗效果。

Abstract: In randomized clinical trials, regression models can be used to explore the
relationships between patients' variables (e.g., clinical, pathological or
lifestyle variables, and also biomarker or genomics data) and the magnitude of
treatment effect. Our aim is to evaluate the value of flexible machine learning
models that can incorporate interactions and nonlinear effects of
high-dimensional data to estimate individualized treatment recommendations in
the setting of such trials with time-to-event outcomes. We compare survival
models based on neural networks (CoxCC and CoxTime) and random survival forests
(Interaction Forests). A Cox model, including an adaptive LASSO penalty, is
used as a benchmark. Specific metrics for individualized treatment
recommendations are used: the C-for-Benefit, the E50-for-Benefit, and RMSE for
treatment benefit. We conduct an extensive simulation study using 2 different
data generation processes incorporating nonlinearity and interactions up to the
third order. The models are applied to gene expression and clinical data from 2
breast cancer studies. The machine learning-based methods show reasonable
performances on the simulation data sets, especially in terms of discrimination
for Interaction Forests and calibration for the neural networks. They can be
used to evaluate individualized treatment effects from randomized trials when
nonlinear and interaction effects are expected to be present.

### [4] [Maximal Speed of Glucose Change Significantly Distinguishes Prediabetes from Diabetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12567)
*Dandan Wang,Xiaoyan Chen,Jingxiang Lin,Teng Zhang,Lianyi Huang,Dongliang Leng,Xiaohua Douglas Zhang,Gang Li*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CGM数据的血糖变化速度指标maxSpeed，并验证了其与其他指标在区分不同糖尿病状态中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速血糖变化对健康有严重影响，需要开发基于CGM数据的评估指标。

Method: 提出maxSpeed指标，并与meanSpeed、sdSpeed等指标进行临床研究，分析其在区分非糖尿病、前驱糖尿病、T1D和T2D中的作用。

Result: maxSpeed能显著区分非糖尿病/前驱糖尿病与T1D/T2D；其他指标在不同糖尿病状态间也有显著区分作用。

Conclusion: maxSpeed能有效评估短期血糖快速变化，具有重要的生物学和临床意义。

Abstract: Rapid changes in blood glucose levels can have severe and immediate health
consequences, leading to the need to develop indices for assessing these rapid
changes based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. We proposed a CGM
index, maxSpeed, that represents the maximum of speed of glucose change (SGC)
in a subject, respectively, and conducted a clinical study to investigate this
index along with SGC mean (meanSpeed) and SGC standard deviation (sdSpeed),
coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), glycemic variability
percentage (GVP), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAG), mean absolute
glucose excursion (MAGE), mean of daily differences (MODD) and continuous
overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA). Our study revealed that, there exist
multiple patterns in distinguishing non-diabetes, prediabetes, type 1 diabetes
(T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). First, maxSpeed significantly distinguishes
between either of non-diabetes and prediabetes and either of T1D and T2D.
Second, meanSpeed, sdSpeed, GVP and MAG significantly distinguish between
non-diabetes and either of T1D and T2D. Third, MODD and CONGA of 24 hours
significantly distinguish between non-diabetes and either of T1D and T2D,
between T1D and either of prediabetes and T2D. Fourth, SD, MAGE and CONGA of 12
hours significantly distinguish between non-diabetes and either of T1D and T2D,
between T1D and pre-diabetes. Fifth, CV significantly distinguishes between T1D
and either of Non-diabetes and T2D. maxSpeed assesses the rapid change of
glucose in a short term, which is important both biologically and clinicially
because our human body may not tolerate too rapid change in a short term.

### [5] [Input-to-state stability-based chemical reaction networks composition for molecular computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12056)
*Renlei Jiang,Yuzhen Fan,Di Fan,Chuanhou Gao,Denis Dochain*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于质量作用动力学的可组合化学反应网络（CRN）框架，解决了现有方法在复杂计算中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可组合性框架主要针对速率无关的CRN，计算能力受限，需要一种系统性框架支持速率相关的CRN以实现更复杂的分子计算。

Method: 引入质量作用化学反应计算机（msCRC）概念，结合动态计算和动态可组合性，建立数学框架，并通过输入到状态稳定性（ISS）条件提供理论支持。

Result: 提出的方法在计算能力和准确性上优于现有技术，并通过示例验证了其效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为速率相关的CRN提供了可组合性理论基础，显著提升了分子计算的潜力。

Abstract: Molecular computation based on chemical reaction networks (CRNs) has emerged
as a promising paradigm for designing programmable biochemical systems.
However, the implementation of complex computations still requires excessively
large and intricate network structures, largely due to the limited
understanding of composability, that is, how multiple subsystems can be coupled
while preserving computational functionality. Existing composability frameworks
primarily focus on rate-independent CRNs, whose computational capabilities are
severely restricted. This article aims to establish a systematic framework for
composable CRNs governed by mass-action kinetics, a common type of
rate-dependent CRNs. Drawing upon the concepts of composable rate-independent
CRNs, we introduce the notions of mass-action chemical reaction computers
(msCRCs), dynamic computation and dynamic composability to establish a rigorous
mathematical framework for composing two or more msCRCs to achieve
layer-by-layer computation of composite functions. Further, we derive several
sufficient conditions based on the notions of input-to-state stability (ISS) to
characterize msCRCs that can be composed to implement desired molecular
computations, thereby providing theoretical support for this framework. Some
examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of our method. Finally,
comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits notable
advantages in both computational ability and accuracy over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: CB通过增强免疫和造血恢复，为辐射相关血液疾病提供潜在治疗策略。

Abstract: Background: Radiation-induced leukopenia caused by low-dose exposure is
frequently associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes like
"blood deficiency" and "fatigue syndrome". Ci Bai Capsule (CB) has been
reported to enhance white blood cell levels; however, its mechanisms and
bioactive compounds remain unclear.Aim: This study aimed to identify the
bioactive compounds group of CB and elucidate its potential mechanisms in
radiation-induced leukopenia.Methods: Syndrome-related data were gathered from
SYMMAP and CTD database. CB's target profile is predicted by DrugCIPHER.
Network pharmacology approaches were employed to identify active compounds and
related pathways. Experimental validation was conducted through flow cytometry
and RNA-sequencing in both ex vivo and in vivo models.Results: A total of 22
pathways related to cellular processes, immune responses, and signal
transduction were identified. Five key bioactive compounds
(kaempferol-3-glucorhamnoside, syringin, schisandrin, 3-hydroxytyrosol
3-O-glucoside and salidroside) were found to significantly modulate
syndrome-related pathways. Optimal dosing of this compound combination enhanced
leukocyte counts and splenic immune cell proliferation in irradiated mice.
Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the compounds exert regulatory effects on
PP1A, RB, CDK4/6, CDK2, and CDK1, thereby modulating downstream immune and
hematopoietic markers such as MNDA, BST2, and HSPA1A.Conclusion: Our findings
suggest that CB mitigates radiation-induced leukopenia by enhancing immune and
hematopoietic recovery, offering a promising therapeutic approach for managing
radiation-related hematological disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究布尔网络吸引盆的稳定性，以理解生物系统中观察到的复杂行为，尤其是网络吸引子与生物表型或细胞类型的对应关系。

Method: 通过数学证明验证了Williadsen、Triesch和Wiles的猜想，并将结果从单一吸引盆扩展到整个网络。

Result: 证明了布尔网络的鲁棒性和吸引盆熵的渐近上界之间存在负线性关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为布尔网络的稳定性提供了理论支持，有助于进一步理解生物系统的复杂行为。

Abstract: Boolean networks, inspired by gene regulatory networks, were developed to
understand the complex behaviors observed in biological systems, with network
attractors corresponding to biological phenotypes or cell types. In this
article, we present a proof for a conjecture by Williadsen, Triesch and Wiles
about upper bounds for the stability of basins of attraction in Boolean
networks. We further extend this result from a single basin of attraction to
the entire network. Specifically, we demonstrate that the asymptotic upper
bound for the robustness and the basin entropy of a Boolean network are
negatively linearly related.

TL;DR: 环糊精（CDs）是环状寡糖，能与客体分子形成包合物。研究发现CDs具有动态灵活性，可容纳比其空腔尺寸更大的分子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管环糊精（CDs）在药物制剂中广泛应用，但其空腔尺寸和动态行为尚未系统研究。

Method: 通过分子动力学模拟，使用不同尺寸的球形探针粒子观察CDs的包合行为。

Result: 结果显示CDs能动态包合比其空腔尺寸更大的分子。

Conclusion: CDs的动态灵活性使其在包合大分子方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of glucopyranose
units bonded together to form a truncated cone that can make inclusion
complexes with guest molecules. The {\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\gamma}-CDs, which
respectively comprise six, seven or eight glucopyranose units, are used
extensively in pharmaceutical formulations as functional excipients. The cavity
sizes of all three natural CDs have been approximated using static structures
but a growing consensus is that the CDs are flexible; moreover, the size range
of molecules that CDs can accommodate has not been systematically studied. Here
the results of molecular dynamics simulations performed using spherical
continuum probe particles of different sizes to observe the complex-forming
behaviour of CDs are presented. Results revealed that CDs can make dynamic
complexes with guest molecules that are larger than their reported cavity
sizes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义的传输强度方程（TIE）框架，用于同时重建折射率波动和衰减系数的空间变化，并通过明场显微镜验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TIE方法在定量相位成像中未考虑复杂折射率的影响，限制了其在研究磁性材料和生物细胞等样品中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种物理上更广义的TIE框架，能够同时重建折射率波动和衰减系数的空间变化，并通过明场显微镜进行实验验证。

Result: 该方法在可测量参数范围内表现出稳健的性能，能够有效获取异质光学结构。

Conclusion: 通过分析TIE框架中衰减反转的对称性，揭示了样品吸收和散射特性的不变性。

Abstract: Although the transport of intensity equation (TIE) can be used to reconstruct
the spatial phase variations produced by samples such as magnetic materials and
biological cells, the impact of complex refractive indices on quantitative
phase imaging remains unexplored. To overcome this difficulty, we provide
herein a more physically generalized TIE framework that enables the
reconstruction of spatial variations in both refractive-index fluctuations and
attenuation coefficients. We then demonstrate this method using bright-field
microscopy imaging. The results reveal robust performance in retrieving
heterogeneous optical structures within measurable parameter regions. Finally,
we analyze the symmetry of the attenuation reversal in the TIE framework, thus
revealing the invariant nature of the absorptive and scattering properties in
the samples of interest.

*Andrea Agazzi,Lucie Laurence*

TL;DR: 本文展示了一个化学反应网络，在确定性质量作用动力学下不稳定，但在随机情况下却表现出正回归性，证明了噪声可以稳定系统动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究噪声如何在不依赖边界效应的情况下稳定原本发散的动力学系统。

Method: 通过状态空间的分解和在各区域构建合适的Lyapunov函数来证明。

Result: 确定性动力学下系统轨迹会在有限时间内爆炸，而随机版本则表现出正回归性。

Conclusion: 噪声可以横向扰动系统的发散轨迹，从而实现稳定化。

Abstract: We present a chemical reaction network that is unstable under deterministic
mass action kinetics, exhibiting finite-time blow-up of trajectories in the
interior of the state space, but whose stochastic counterpart is positive
recurrent. This provides an example of noise-induced stabilization of the
model's dynamics arising due to noise perturbing transversally the divergent
trajectories of the system that is independently of boundary effects. The proof
is based on a careful decomposition of the state space and the construction of
suitable Lyapunov functions in each region.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新方法，结合图神经网络和Transformer，用于从患者表型预测致病基因，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准医学中从患者表型识别致病基因具有重要诊断和治疗意义，但现有方法仍有不足。

Method: 整合罕见病知识图谱，结合图神经网络和Transformer，支持有无候选基因列表的情况。

Result: 在MyGene2数据集上，MRR为24.64%，nDCG@100为33.64%，优于SHEPHERD基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在表型数据单独可用时仍有效，解决了基因组信息不完整时的临床决策挑战。

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant
challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis
and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for
predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an
available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge
graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers,
achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the
real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\%
and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR
and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the
contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to
cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in
clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LapDDPM是一种新型的图扩散概率模型，用于生成高质量、生物学合理的单细胞RNA测序数据，通过结合图表示和扩散模型，并引入谱对抗扰动机制，显著提升了生成数据的保真度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据的高维性、稀疏性和复杂生物变异性使得生成高质量、条件可控的合成数据具有挑战性，现有生成模型难以有效捕捉这些特性。

Method: LapDDPM结合了图表示和扩散模型，利用拉普拉斯位置编码（LPEs）丰富潜在空间信息，开发了条件扩散模型，并采用谱对抗训练机制增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，LapDDPM在多种单细胞RNA测序数据集上表现优异，生成的数据具有高保真度和生物学合理性。

Conclusion: LapDDPM为条件性单细胞RNA测序数据生成设定了新标准，为下游生物应用提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is
challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological
variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique
characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks.
We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model
for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates
graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a
novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our
contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs)
to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we
develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and
generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique
spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness
against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq
datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity
and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets
a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust
tool for various downstream biological applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果表示学习方法（CRL）无法将潜在因素与已知生物过程结合，导致模型缺乏可解释性。

Method: 基于discrepancy-VAE，提出SENA-discrepancy-VAE模型，通过SENA-δ编码器将生物过程活动映射到潜在因果因素。

Result: 模型在未见干预组合上的预测性能与原模型相当，同时推断出具有生物学意义的潜在因果因素。

Conclusion: SENA-discrepancy-VAE在保持预测性能的同时，显著提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function
is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately
leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning
(CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify
the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating
the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods
fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known
biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address
this major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the
recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations
where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the
activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present
an encoder, SENA-{\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological
processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that
SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of
interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable
counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically
meaningful.

Conclusion: 该栖息地地图产品对保护和恢复工作具有重要价值，同时提供了预测不确定性和层级信息。

Abstract: The EUNIS habitat classification is crucial for categorising European
habitats, supporting European policy on nature conservation and implementing
the Nature Restoration Law. To meet the growing demand for detailed and
accurate habitat information, we provide spatial predictions for 260 EUNIS
habitat types at hierarchical level 3, together with independent validation and
uncertainty analyses.
  Using ensemble machine learning models, together with high-resolution
satellite imagery and ecologically meaningful climatic, topographic and edaphic
variables, we produced a European habitat map indicating the most probable
EUNIS habitat at 100-m resolution across Europe. Additionally, we provide
information on prediction uncertainty and the most probable habitats at level 3
within each EUNIS level 1 formation. This product is particularly useful for
both conservation and restoration purposes.
  Predictions were cross-validated at European scale using a spatial block
cross-validation and evaluated against independent data from France (forests
only), the Netherlands and Austria. The habitat maps obtained strong predictive
performances on the validation datasets with distinct trade-offs in terms of
recall and precision across habitat formations.

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段通过因子分析从代理变量中提取潜在因子作为未测量混杂的替代；第二阶段利用该模型构建协变量以改进因果效应估计。

Result: 模拟和实际应用表明，该方法在假设违反情况下仍能提供比传统方法更可靠的估计。

Conclusion: 该方法为应用研究者提供了一种实用的工具，用于通过代理变量解决未测量混杂问题。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) are used to study treatment effects in
clinical settings, yet unmeasured confounding remains a persistent challenge.
Indirect measurements of the unmeasured confounder (proxies) offer a potential
solution, but existing approaches -- such as proximal inference or full joint
modeling -- can be difficult to implement. We propose a two-stage, proxy-based
method that is practical, broadly applicable, and robust. In the first stage,
we apply factor analysis to proxy and treatment variables, extracting
information on latent factors that serve as a surrogate for the unmeasured
confounder. In the second stage, we use this model to build covariates that
improve causal effect estimation in a standard outcome regression model.
Through simulations, we test the method's performance under assumption
violations, including non-normal errors, model misspecification, and scenarios
where instruments or confounders are incorrectly treated as proxies. We also
apply the method to estimate the effect of hospital admission for older adults
presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, a setting where
standard analyses may fail to recover plausible effects. Our results show that
this simplified strategy recovers more reliable estimates than conventional
adjustment methods, offering applied researchers a practical tool for
addressing unmeasured confounding with proxy variables.

Motivation: 解决模块化神经网络中信号传播精确控制的基本挑战。

Method: 使用尖峰随机块模型网络，比较随机采样和基于拓扑的中心性度量（如度、介数、接近性、特征向量、谐波和渗透中心性）来选择驱动节点。

Result: 针对性刺激源群体中最中心的10-20%神经元，信号传输效率提高2.7倍。

Conclusion: 为生物神经系统和神经技术应用中的精确神经调控提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework
for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission
between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model
networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies -
including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree,
betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to
determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population
synchronization.
  Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source
population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to
random selection. This approach yields a 2.7-fold increase in signal transfer
efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities p_inter = 0.04-0.07.
These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation
in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.

Method: 使用公开和私有数据集，通过零样本和单样本提示方法评估VLMs（如GPT-4.1和Gemini 2.5 Pro）的表现，并与定制训练的CNN进行对比。

Result: 单样本提示显著优于零样本提示（p≈1.005×10^-5），但通用VLMs在大多数任务中仍不及监督学习的CNN。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在专业领域（如病理学）中的应用具有潜力但仍有局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced alongside Large Language
Models (LLMs). This study evaluates the capabilities of prominent generative
VLMs, such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, accessed via APIs, for histopathology
image classification tasks, including cell typing. Using diverse datasets from
public and private sources, we apply zero-shot and one-shot prompting methods
to assess VLM performance, comparing them against custom-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Our findings demonstrate that while one-shot prompting
significantly improves VLM performance over zero-shot ($p \approx 1.005 \times
10^{-5}$ based on Kappa scores), these general-purpose VLMs currently
underperform supervised CNNs on most tasks. This work underscores both the
promise and limitations of applying current VLMs to specialized domains like
pathology via in-context learning. All code and instructions for reproducing
