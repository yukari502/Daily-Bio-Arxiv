It plays a critical role in gene\nannotation and the study of gene functions. Accurate spliced alignment demands\nsophisticated modeling of splice sites, but current aligners use simple models,\nwhich may affect their accuracy given dissimilar sequences.\n  Results: We implemented minisplice to learn splice signals with a\none-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and trained a model with\n7,026 parameters for vertebrate and insect genomes. It captures conserved\nsplice signals across phyla and reveals GC-rich introns specific to mammals and\nbirds. We used this model to estimate the empirical splicing probability for\nevery GT and AG in genomes, and modified minimap2 and miniprot to leverage\npre-computed splicing probability during alignment.
