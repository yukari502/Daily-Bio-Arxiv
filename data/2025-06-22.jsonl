By constructing attractor\nmatrices based on single-node perturbations, we propose a framework to quantify\nattractor stability and identify dominant attractors. We find that attractors\nare more stable than predicted by basin sizes, showing the importance of\ndynamical structure in noisy environments. In addition, under global\nperturbations, basin sizes dictate long-term behavior; under local noise,\nhowever, attractor dominance is determined by noise-induced transition patterns\nrather than basin sizes. Our results show that transition dynamics induced by\nstochastic perturbations provide an efficient and quantitative description for\nthe attractor stability and dynamics in Boolean networks under noise."}

Unlike prior\napproaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly\nseparates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To\nsupport this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where\neach protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for\nstructure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language\nmodel. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and\nuniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence\nbetween structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing\nis performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated\nlatent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation\nlearning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with\nexisting methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.\nOn a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a\nboth-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in\ncoordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits."}

We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a\n671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)\nexemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based\nframework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial\ndatasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,\ninformation geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive\npatient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively\ncontracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A\npseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of\nhigher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects\ncompact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles (\"Personas\").\n  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary\nlayer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects\ndomain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors\nthe human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,\nforming a self-improving loop.\n  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI\nuncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline\nmodels (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few\nfeatures. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,\ninformation geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging\nconcept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive\nArchitecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI\noffers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical\ndiscovery."}

To address this gap, we\npresent AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D\non automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose\nmonitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,\ncarbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained\nover 6 to 8 weeks for each patient.
