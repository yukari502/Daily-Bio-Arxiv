Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans,
is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history.
Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP
are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory
equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for
point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable
RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for
acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within
one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is
approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of
RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P.
infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P.
sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P.
infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop
laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis
capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the
third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms
observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system
decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on
specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease
detection and control in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设突变类型在特征矩阵中独立，忽略了潜在的依赖关系，限制了分析的准确性。

Result: 新方法收敛更快，在小样本情况下准确性更高，并能更好地理解生物学相互作用。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来研究提供了基础，适用于更广泛的非负矩阵分解应用。

Abstract: Somatic mutations, or alterations in DNA of a somatic cell, are key markers
of cancer. In recent years, mutational signature analysis has become a
prominent field of study within cancer research, commonly with Nonnegative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Bayesian NMF. However, current methods assume
independence across mutation types in the signatures matrix. This paper expands
upon current Bayesian NMF methodologies by proposing novel methods that account
for the dependencies between the mutation types. First, we implement the
Bayesian NMF specification with a Multivariate Truncated Normal prior on the
signatures matrix in order to model the covariance structure using external
information, in our case estimated from the COSMIC signatures database. This
model converges in fewer iterations, using MCMC, when compared to a model with
independent Truncated Normal priors on elements of the signatures matrix and
results in improvements in accuracy, especially on small sample sizes. In
addition, we develop a hierarchical model that allows the covariance structure
of the signatures matrix to be discovered rather than specified upfront, giving
the algorithm more flexibility. This flexibility for the algorithm to learn the
dependence structure of the signatures allows a better understanding of
biological interactions and how these change across different types of cancer.
The code for this project is contributed to an open-source R software package.
Our work lays the groundwork for future research to incorporate dependency
structure across mutation types in the signatures matrix and is also applicable
to any use of NMF beyond just single-base substitution (SBS) mutational
signatures.

### [3] [Quantification of Information Flow by Dual Reporter System and Its Application to Bacterial Chemotaxis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15957)
*Kento Nakamura,Hajime Fukuoka,Akihiko Ishijima,Tetsuya J. Kobayashi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双报告系统的互信息估计方法，无需测量输入分布，适用于细胞信号通路的信息量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息是量化细胞信号通路的理论指标，但传统方法需要同时测量输入和输出分布，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过扩展外源-内源噪声分析，利用双报告系统推导出互信息估计器，避免测量输入分布。

Result: 在细菌趋化通路中验证了方法的有效性，并展示了信息流的生物学相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化细胞信号通路中的信息流提供了新途径。

Abstract: Mutual information is a theoretically grounded metric for quantifying
cellular signaling pathways. However, its measurement demands characterization
of both input and output distributions, limiting practical applications. Here,
we present alternative method that alleviates this requirement using dual
reporter systems. By extending extrinsic-intrinsic noise analysis, we derive a
mutual information estimator that eliminates the need to measure input
distribution. We demonstrate our method by analyzing the bacterial chemotactic
pathway, regarding multiple flagellar motors as natural dual reporters. We show
the biological relevance of the measured information flow by comparing it with
theoretical bounds on sensory information. This framework opens new
possibilities for quantifying information flow in cellular signaling pathways.

### [4] [Geometric deep learning assists protein engineering. Opportunities and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16091)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蛋白质设计方法（如理性设计和定向进化）受限于序列空间复杂性和实验成本，GDL通过非欧几里得域操作解决这些问题。

Method: GDL应用于稳定性预测、功能注释、分子相互作用建模和从头设计，结合可解释AI和结构验证提升模型泛化性和鲁棒性。

Result: GDL在数据稀缺条件下表现优异，与生成模型和高通量实验结合，成为蛋白质工程和合成生物学的核心技术。

Conclusion: GDL为蛋白质工程提供透明、自主的设计框架，推动领域迈向下一代技术。

Abstract: Protein engineering is experiencing a paradigmatic shift through the
integration of geometric deep learning into computational design workflows.
While traditional strategies, such as rational design and directed evolution,
have enabled relevant advances, they remain limited by the complexity of
sequence space and the cost of experimental validation. Geometric deep learning
addresses these limitations by operating on non-Euclidean domains, capturing
spatial, topological, and physicochemical features essential to protein
function. This perspective outlines the current applications of GDL across
stability prediction, functional annotation, molecular interaction modeling,
and de novo protein design. We highlight recent methodological advances in
model generalization, interpretability, and robustness, particularly under
data-scarce conditions. A unified framework is proposed that integrates GDL
with explainable AI and structure-based validation to support transparent,
autonomous design. As GDL converges with generative modeling and
high-throughput experimentation, it is emerging as a central technology in
next-generation protein engineering and synthetic biology.

### [5] [SHREC and PHEONA: Using Large Language Models to Advance Next-Generation Computational Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16359)
*Sarah Pungitore,Shashank Yadav,Molly Douglas,Jarrod Mosier,Vignesh Subbian*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出SHREC框架，利用轻量级LLMs（如Gemma2、Mistral、Phi-4）进行自动化计算表型分析，结果显示模型在概念分类和表型分析中表现良好，尤其是Mistral模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算表型分析依赖人工审核，效率低且难以跨数据源适应。LLMs在文本处理方面表现优异，有望替代人工完成重复性任务。

Method: 开发SHREC框架，测试三种轻量级LLMs（Gemma2、Mistral、Phi-4）在ARF呼吸支持疗法表型分析中的表现。

Result: Mistral模型表现最佳，概念分类AUROC达0.896，单疗法表型分析AUROC达0.853，多疗法表现稍逊。

Conclusion: 轻量级LLMs可有效辅助资源密集型表型分析任务，未来需优化生物医学数据整合和LLMs推理能力。

Abstract: Objective: Computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with
resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications. However, it is
time-intensive because of manual data review, limited automation, and
difficulties in adapting algorithms across sources. Since LLMs have
demonstrated promising capabilities for text classification, comprehension, and
generation, we posit they will perform well at repetitive manual review tasks
traditionally performed by human experts. To support next-generation
computational phenotyping methods, we developed SHREC, a framework for
comprehensive integration of LLMs into end-to-end phenotyping pipelines.
Materials and Methods: We applied and tested the ability of three lightweight
LLMs (Gemma2 27 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) to
classify concepts and phenotype patients using previously developed phenotypes
for ARF respiratory support therapies. Results: All models performed well on
concept classification, with the best model (Mistral) achieving an AUROC of
0.896 across all relevant concepts. For phenotyping, models demonstrated
near-perfect specificity for all phenotypes, and the top-performing model
(Mistral) reached an average AUROC of 0.853 for single-therapy phenotypes,
despite lower performance on multi-therapy phenotypes. Discussion: There are
several advantages of LLMs that support their application to computational
phenotyping, such as their ability to adapt to new tasks with prompt
engineering alone and their ability to incorporate raw EHR data. Future steps
to advance next-generation phenotyping methods include determining optimal
strategies for integrating biomedical data, exploring how LLMs reason, and
advancing generative model methods. Conclusion: Current lightweight LLMs can
feasibly assist researchers with resource-intensive phenotyping tasks such as
manual data review.

### [6] [EHCube4P: Learning Epistatic Patterns Through Hypercube Graph Convolution Neural Network for Protein Fitness Function Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16921)
*Muhammad Daud,Philippe Charton,Cedric Damour,Jingbo Wang,Frederic Cadet*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合小波去噪和图卷积神经网络（GCN）的新框架EHCube4P，用于预测蛋白质适应性，并在稀疏和噪声数据中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质序列与功能关系的研究对蛋白质工程至关重要，但组合庞大的序列空间和实验噪声阻碍了这一任务。

Method: 将序列景观建模为超立方体$H(k,2)$，结合小波去噪和GCN，通过多层感知机（MLP）预测蛋白质适应性。

Result: EHCube4P在不同酶活性数据集中表现良好，能捕捉高阶突变相互作用，适应性预测的鲁棒性和泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合小波预处理和图深度学习的方法为蛋白质适应性估计提供了可扩展且可解释的框架，适用于广泛的组合生物系统。

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between protein sequences and their functions
is fundamental to protein engineering, but this task is hindered by the
combinatorially vast sequence space and the experimental noise inherent in
fitness measurements. In this study, we present a novel framework that models
the sequence landscape as a hypercube $H(k,2)$ and integrates wavelet-based
signal denoising with a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to predict
protein fitness across rugged fitness landscapes. Using a dataset of 419
experimentally measured mutant sequences of the Tobacco 5-Epi-Aristolochene
Synthase (TEAS) enzyme, we preprocess the fitness signals using a 1-D discrete
wavelet transform with a Daubechies-3 basis to suppress experimental noise
while preserving local epistatic patterns. Our model comprises two GCN layers,
allowing for beyond pairwise aggregation, followed by a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP). We show that our approach, EHCube4P, generalizes well across different
enzyme activity datasets and effectively captures higher-order mutational
interactions. Performance varies with the ruggedness of the fitness landscape,
with smoother signals yielding higher test set $r^2$ scores. These results
demonstrate that combining wavelet preprocessing with graph-based deep learning
enhances the robustness and generalization of fitness prediction, particularly
for sparse and noisy biological datasets. The approach provides a scalable and
interpretable framework for protein fitness estimation applicable to a broad
range of combinatorial biological systems.

### [7] [Central Dogma Cycle and Network: A Model for Cell Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16374)
*Martin R. Schiller*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态的分子生物学中心法则扩展模型（CDC）和更广泛的网络（CDCN），强调细胞信息流的循环性及其在细胞记忆中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的中心法则不足以完全解释细胞记忆和信息管理，因此需要扩展模型以纳入蛋白质折叠和网络化等步骤。

Method: 提出CDC和CDCN模型，类比计算机内存功能（输入、读取、写入、执行和擦除），解释细胞信息的循环流动。

Result: CDC和CDCN模型揭示了细胞记忆的新机制，类似于计算机内存中的锁存器，为遗传和疾病病理提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 通过循环网络模型理解细胞记忆，为遗传、细胞过程和疾病病理提供了新的研究框架。

Abstract: This paper proposes an extension of the traditional Central Dogma of
molecular biology to a more dynamic model termed the Central Dogma Cycle (CDC)
and a broader network called the Central Dogma Cyclic Network (CDCN). While the
Central Dogma is necessary for genetic information flow, it is not sufficient
to fully explain cellular memory and information management. The CDC
incorporates additional well-established steps, including protein folding and
protein networking, highlighting the cyclical nature of information flow in
cells. This cyclic architecture is proposed as a key mechanism for cellular
memory, drawing analogies to memory functions in computers, such as input,
read, write, execute, and erase. The interconnected cycles within the CDCN,
including metabolic cycles and signaling pathways, are suggested to function
akin to latches in computer memory, contributing to the storage and processing
of cellular information beyond nucleic acid sequences. Understanding cellular
memory through this cyclic network model offers a new perspective on heredity,
cell processes, and the potential disruptions in disease pathology.

### [8] [Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629)
*Eric V. Strobl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEBIAS算法通过优化结果定义以最大化因果可识别性，解决了精神病学纵向数据中因果推断的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神病学中症状异质性和潜在混杂因素常导致传统估计器失效，现有方法假设结果变量固定且通过观察协变量调整解决混杂，但实践中无混杂假设可能不成立。

Method: DEBIAS算法学习非负、临床可解释的权重以聚合结果，最大化持久治疗效果，并利用精神病学纵向数据中先前治疗的时滞直接效应最小化观察和潜在混杂。

Result: DEBIAS在抑郁和精神分裂症的综合实验中，始终优于现有方法，恢复临床可解释复合结果的因果效应。

Conclusion: DEBIAS通过优化结果定义和最小化混杂，显著提升了精神病学纵向数据中的因果推断能力。

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,
especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding
frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment
effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding
through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of
unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this
foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to
maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with
Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,
clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable
treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent
confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments
in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically
verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically
interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression
and schizophrenia.
