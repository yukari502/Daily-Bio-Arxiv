Here in this study, we report a portable\nRPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for\nacquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)\nmicroneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within\none minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is\napproximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of\nRPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P.\ninfestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P.\nsojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P.\ninfestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop\nlaboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis\ncapability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the\nthird and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms\nobserved on the leaves.

In recent years, mutational signature analysis has become a\nprominent field of study within cancer research, commonly with Nonnegative\nMatrix Factorization (NMF) and Bayesian NMF. However, current methods assume\nindependence across mutation types in the signatures matrix. This paper expands\nupon current Bayesian NMF methodologies by proposing novel methods that account\nfor the dependencies between the mutation types. First, we implement the\nBayesian NMF specification with a Multivariate Truncated Normal prior on the\nsignatures matrix in order to model the covariance structure using external\ninformation, in our case estimated from the COSMIC signatures database. This\nmodel converges in fewer iterations, using MCMC, when compared to a model with\nindependent Truncated Normal priors on elements of the signatures matrix and\nresults in improvements in accuracy, especially on small sample sizes. In\naddition, we develop a hierarchical model that allows the covariance structure\nof the signatures matrix to be discovered rather than specified upfront, giving\nthe algorithm more flexibility. This flexibility for the algorithm to learn the\ndependence structure of the signatures allows a better understanding of\nbiological interactions and how these change across different types of cancer.\nThe code for this project is contributed to an open-source R software package.\nOur work lays the groundwork for future research to incorporate dependency\nstructure across mutation types in the signatures matrix and is also applicable\nto any use of NMF beyond just single-base substitution (SBS) mutational\nsignatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u7a81\u53d8\u7c7b\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u764c\u75c7\u7a81\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7a81\u53d8\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5143\u622a\u65ad\u6b63\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff08COSMIC\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff09\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, it is\ntime-intensive because of manual data review, limited automation, and\ndifficulties in adapting algorithms across sources. Since LLMs have\ndemonstrated promising capabilities for text classification, comprehension, and\ngeneration, we posit they will perform well at repetitive manual review tasks\ntraditionally performed by human experts. To support next-generation\ncomputational phenotyping methods, we developed SHREC, a framework for\ncomprehensive integration of LLMs into end-to-end phenotyping pipelines.\nMaterials and Methods: We applied and tested the ability of three lightweight\nLLMs (Gemma2 27 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) to\nclassify concepts and phenotype patients using previously developed phenotypes\nfor ARF respiratory support therapies. Results: All models performed well on\nconcept classification, with the best model (Mistral) achieving an AUROC of\n0.896 across all relevant concepts. For phenotyping, models demonstrated\nnear-perfect specificity for all phenotypes, and the top-performing model\n(Mistral) reached an average AUROC of 0.853 for single-therapy phenotypes,\ndespite lower performance on multi-therapy phenotypes. Discussion: There are\nseveral advantages of LLMs that support their application to computational\nphenotyping, such as their ability to adapt to new tasks with prompt\nengineering alone and their ability to incorporate raw EHR data. Future steps\nto advance next-generation phenotyping methods include determining optimal\nstrategies for integrating biomedical data, exploring how LLMs reason, and\nadvancing generative model methods.
