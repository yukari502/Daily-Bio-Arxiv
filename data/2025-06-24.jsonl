We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient\nfoundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being\npre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong\nmultimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial\nand temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a\nunified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models\nstructural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph\ntransformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful,\nmodality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion\ngate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger\nmodels on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification,\nprediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our\nmodel revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a\nunique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration).\nBrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can\nsurpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and\npowerful research in computational neuroscience."}

In this study, we present a modified version of\nthe test that can be computed analytically. This analytical version showed a\nminimum Pearson correlation of 0.95 with the conventional Monte Carlo-based\nmethod across eight spatial omics datasets, but with substantial speed-ups.\nAdditional experiments on a large Xenium dataset demonstrated the method's\nability to efficiently analyze large-scale data, making it a valuable tool for\nanalyzing spatial omics data."}

Here\nwe present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1\nmillion simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary\ndeterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen\nrules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step\nforecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional\n(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results\ndemonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space\nyields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and\ninverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that\ntransformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data\nalone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical\nphenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue\nengineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery."}

Although the contributions\nof the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward loops to output\nvariability have been well characterized, the impact of their joint action\narising from their shared input and output remains poorly understood. Here, we\nidentify an additional component of noise that emerges specifically from this\nconvergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene correlations, we reveal the\nregulatory basis of the additional noise and interpret it as synergy or\nredundancy in noise propagation, depending on whether the combined pathways\namplify or suppress fluctuations. This framework not only accounts for\npreviously observed differences in noise behavior across coherent and\nincoherent feed-forward loops but also provides a generalizable strategy to\nconnect network structure with stochastic gene regulation."}

This criterion is better able to encompass changes in the quality of\nthe parameter estimate due to increased noise in the data (compared to existing\ncriteria based solely on average relative errors). Furthermore, we leverage a\nweak-form equation error-based method of parameter estimation for systems with\nunobserved variables to assess practical identifiability far more quickly in\ncomparison to output error-based parameter estimation. We do so by generating\nweak-form input-output equations using differential algebra techniques, as\npreviously proposed by Boulier et al [1], and then applying Weak form\nEstimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) to obtain parameter estimates. This\nmethod is computationally efficient and robust to noise, as demonstrated\nthrough two classical biological modelling examples."}
