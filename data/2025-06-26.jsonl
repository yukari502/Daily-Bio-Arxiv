The classical\nRayleigh-Plateau instability concerns liquid jets governed by inertia and\nsurface tension, whereas biological tubes are membrane-bounded and\ninertia-free. We therefore refer to the process observed here as a pearling\ninstability, formally analogous to Rayleigh-Plateau but dominated by membrane\nmechanics. Although pearling-type instabilities have long been recognised in\nlipid tubes and some biological systems, a clear physiological example remained\nelusive. Here, we present results showing that pearling instability occurs\nduring the physiological process of platelet formation. Platelets are formed\nfrom megakaryocytes in the bone marrow by the extension of long protrusions,\ncalled proplatelets, that traverse the blood vessels. As they extend in the\nbloodstream, proplatelets become pearled and detach. Long and pearled\nproplatelets then circulate in the peripheral blood before their fragmentation\ninto calibrated platelets. We propose that this pearling, by creating regular\nconstrictions along the proplatelet, is key to the process of proplatelet\nfragmentation into individual platelets of calibrated size. Pearling\ninstability thus acts as a mechanobiological regulator allowing local delivery\nof the right size platelets to the right place at the right time. Our\nobservations quantitatively match parameter-free theoretical predictions for\nmembrane pearling, supporting a unified physical picture."}

We\nintroduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking\nframework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket\nexploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established\nbenchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and\nPoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically\nvalid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when\njointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while\nremaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD\nalone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.\nPocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy\nacross ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce\nTargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000\nprotein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem\nactivity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully\ndiscriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning\nbaseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina\noffers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific\ntraining and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for\nhigh-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery."}

Rodriguez"], "title": "Behavioral Traits as Dynamical Systems: Utilizing Entropy to Analyze Longitudinal Psychometric Data in Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations", "categories": ["q-bio.QM", "physics.bio-ph"], "comment": "28 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Traits such as neuroticism persist across species despite exhibiting\ncharacteristics typically regarded as maladaptive. This project presents an\nalternative model for understanding the stability of such traits by integrating\nfindings from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (Pedersen, 2015) (SATSA)\nwith a system of recursive, biologically inspired ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). To utilize the ODEs analytically, Shannon entropy is\nextracted from longitudinal Likert-scale psychometric data, enabling the\ntranslation of high-dimensional behavioral responses into continuous-time\ndynamical systems. The model incorporates principles from evolutionary biology,\nincluding mutation-selection balance, genetic pleiotropy and metabolic\nconstraints, and embeds environmental feedback as a recursive driver of\nphenotypic expression. The argument is presented that traits such as\nneuroticism exist not stochastically, but as emergent multistable attractors\nwithin a biologically-constrained system. This paper shows that entropy\nextracted from longitudinal psychometric data can be meaningfully modeled using\nrecursive ordinary differential equations, revealing stable dynamical\nattractors and biologically and environmentally grounded constraints in traits\noften deemed maladaptive. This framework offers a scalable, mathematically\ngrounded foundation for analyzing phenotypic expression, with the ultimate goal\nof biological extension for eventual multi-omic modeling of behavioral traits."}

However, the visual\nobservation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. In\ndigital image analysis, the RGB intensities are affected by staining and\nimaging variations, hindering direct quantification of color in\nPapanicolaou-stained samples. Stain unmixing is a promising alternative that\nquantifies the amounts of dyes. In previous work, multispectral imaging was\nutilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain for quantitative\ndiagnosis. Still, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the\nnumber of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel\nPapanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images that incorporates three key\nassumptions: nonnegative stain abundances; a sparse spatial distribution of\nhematoxylin, which binds to nuclei; and piecewise smoothness of stain\nabundances. By formulating this as an optimization problem with nonnegativity,\nweighted nucleus sparsity, and total variation regularizations, our method\nachieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against\nthe results of multispectral imaging. We also adopted the proposed method for\ndiscriminating lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a\nprecancerous lesion of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The resulting\nquantification distinctly characterized differences between LEGH and normal\nendocervical cells with stain abundance, and a classifier based on the\nquantification results achieved 98.0% accuracy. This demonstrates the\nsignificant potential of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis."}
