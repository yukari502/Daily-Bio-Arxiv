Abstract: At the end of the 19th century, Rayleigh and Plateau explained the physical
principle behind the fragmentation of a liquid jet into regular droplets
commonly observed in everyday life from a faucet. The classical
Rayleigh-Plateau instability concerns liquid jets governed by inertia and
surface tension, whereas biological tubes are membrane-bounded and
inertia-free. We therefore refer to the process observed here as a pearling
instability, formally analogous to Rayleigh-Plateau but dominated by membrane
mechanics. Although pearling-type instabilities have long been recognised in
lipid tubes and some biological systems, a clear physiological example remained
elusive. Here, we present results showing that pearling instability occurs
during the physiological process of platelet formation. Platelets are formed
from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow by the extension of long protrusions,
called proplatelets, that traverse the blood vessels. As they extend in the
bloodstream, proplatelets become pearled and detach. Long and pearled
proplatelets then circulate in the peripheral blood before their fragmentation
into calibrated platelets. We propose that this pearling, by creating regular
constrictions along the proplatelet, is key to the process of proplatelet
fragmentation into individual platelets of calibrated size. Pearling
instability thus acts as a mechanobiological regulator allowing local delivery
of the right size platelets to the right place at the right time. Our
observations quantitatively match parameter-free theoretical predictions for
membrane pearling, supporting a unified physical picture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子对接中未见过或结构多样目标的物理有效配体结合姿态采样难题。

Method: 结合口袋预测和系统性多口袋探索的搜索型对接框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，物理有效性高，且在大规模数据集上能区分活性与非活性目标。

Conclusion: PocketVina是一种无需任务特定训练、高效且可扩展的对接策略，适用于高通量虚拟筛选和药物发现。

Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in
molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We
introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking
framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket
exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established
benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and
PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically
valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when
jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while
remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD
alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.
PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy
across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce
TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000
protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem
activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully
discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning
baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina
offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific
training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for
high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.

Abstract: Traits such as neuroticism persist across species despite exhibiting
characteristics typically regarded as maladaptive. This project presents an
alternative model for understanding the stability of such traits by integrating
findings from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (Pedersen, 2015) (SATSA)
with a system of recursive, biologically inspired ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). To utilize the ODEs analytically, Shannon entropy is
extracted from longitudinal Likert-scale psychometric data, enabling the
translation of high-dimensional behavioral responses into continuous-time
dynamical systems. The model incorporates principles from evolutionary biology,
including mutation-selection balance, genetic pleiotropy and metabolic
constraints, and embeds environmental feedback as a recursive driver of
phenotypic expression. The argument is presented that traits such as
neuroticism exist not stochastically, but as emergent multistable attractors
within a biologically-constrained system. This paper shows that entropy
extracted from longitudinal psychometric data can be meaningfully modeled using
recursive ordinary differential equations, revealing stable dynamical
attractors and biologically and environmentally grounded constraints in traits
often deemed maladaptive. This framework offers a scalable, mathematically
grounded foundation for analyzing phenotypic expression, with the ultimate goal
of biological extension for eventual multi-omic modeling of behavioral traits.

*Joyce Reimer,Pranta Saha,Chris Chen,Neeraj Dhar,Brook Byrns,Steven Rayan,Gordon Broderick*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 该论文展示了在GPU计算环境中实现全局优化算法，显著加速了生物调控网络逻辑模型的参数搜索问题，效率提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物网络的复杂调控动态可以通过离散逻辑模型简洁捕捉，但大规模参数搜索空间需要性能优化，以支持药物研究。

Method: 在GPU环境中实现全局优化算法，对两个模型生物调控系统进行参数搜索，比较GPU与CPU的性能差异。

Result: GPU实现的效率提升显著：相比多线程CPU提升33%-43%，相比串行CPU提升33%-1866%。

Conclusion: GPU加速使全局优化逻辑模型识别成为更可行的方法，适用于计算机假设生成和实验设计。

Abstract: The complex regulatory dynamics of a biological network can be succinctly
captured using discrete logic models. Given even sparse time-course data from
the system of interest, previous work has shown that global optimization
schemes are suitable for proposing logic models that explain the data and make
predictions about how the system will behave under varying conditions.
Considering the large scale of the parameter search spaces associated with
these regulatory systems, performance optimizations on the level of both
hardware and software are necessary for making this a practical tool for in
silico pharmaceutical research. We show here how the implementation of these
global optimization algorithms in a GPU-computing environment can accelerate
the solution of these parameter search problems considerably. We carry out
parameter searches on two model biological regulatory systems that represent
almost an order of magnitude scale-up in complexity, and we find the gains in
efficiency from GPU to be a 33%-43% improvement compared to multi-thread CPU
implementations and a 33%-1866% increase compared to CPU in serial. These
improvements make global optimization of logic model identification a far more
attractive and feasible method for in silico hypothesis generation and design
of experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决蛋白质功能注释、物理化学性质计算和结构可视化分离导致的繁琐和易错问题。

Method: 开发ProCaliper库，从UniProt和AlphaFold获取数据，计算残基级性质（如电荷、溶剂可及性），并交互式可视化结果。

Result: ProCaliper成功整合了功能与结构信息，支持构建和稀疏化残基距离网络。

Abstract: Understanding protein function at the molecular level requires connecting
residue-level annotations with physical and structural properties. This can be
cumbersome and error-prone when functional annotation, computation of
physico-chemical properties, and structure visualization are separated. To
address this, we introduce ProCaliper, an open-source Python library for
computing and visualizing physico-chemical properties of proteins. It can
retrieve annotation and structure data from UniProt and AlphaFold databases,
compute residue-level properties such as charge, solvent accessibility, and
protonation state, and interactively visualize the results of these
computations along with user-supplied residue-level data. Additionally,
ProCaliper incorporates functional and structural information to construct and
optionally sparsify networks that encode the distance between residues and/or
annotated functional sites or regions. The package ProCaliper and its source
code, along with the code used to generate the figures in this manuscript, are
freely available at https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/ProCaliper.

### [7] [Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing for RGB Image Using Weighted Nucleus Sparsity and Total Variation Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20450)

<details>

Result: 方法在染色量化上表现优异，验证了多光谱成像结果。在LEGH诊断中，染色量化结果区分明显，分类器准确率达98.0%。

Conclusion: RGB染色分离方法在定量诊断中潜力显著，为宫颈癌前病变提供了高效量化工具。

Abstract: The Papanicolaou stain, consisting of eosin Y, hematoxylin, light Green SF
yellowish, orange G, and Bismarck brown Y, provides extensive color information
essential for cervical cancer screening in cytopathology. However, the visual
observation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. In
digital image analysis, the RGB intensities are affected by staining and
imaging variations, hindering direct quantification of color in
Papanicolaou-stained samples. Stain unmixing is a promising alternative that
quantifies the amounts of dyes. In previous work, multispectral imaging was
utilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain for quantitative
diagnosis. Still, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the
number of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel
Papanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images that incorporates three key
assumptions: nonnegative stain abundances; a sparse spatial distribution of
hematoxylin, which binds to nuclei; and piecewise smoothness of stain
abundances. By formulating this as an optimization problem with nonnegativity,
weighted nucleus sparsity, and total variation regularizations, our method
achieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against
the results of multispectral imaging. We also adopted the proposed method for
discriminating lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a
precancerous lesion of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The resulting
quantification distinctly characterized differences between LEGH and normal
endocervical cells with stain abundance, and a classifier based on the
quantification results achieved 98.0% accuracy. This demonstrates the
significant potential of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.
