Conclusion: PDE发现方法在生物系统多尺度建模中具有应用前景，尤其是从微观数据推断宏观行为。

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the
physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes
the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their
activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that
require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging
gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)
discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from
micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining
particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary
experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate
five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of
calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated
on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal
variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods
accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE
discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from
microscopic data.

### [2] [Devising a solution to the problems of Cancer awareness in Telangana](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21500)
*Priyanka Avhad,Vedanti Kshirsagar,Urvi Ranjan,Mahek Nakhua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的分类模型，用于预测乳腺癌和宫颈癌的易感性，并结合地理位置提供医疗建议，旨在提高癌症筛查意识和降低死亡率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Telangana地区对乳腺癌和宫颈癌的筛查率极低（2020年分别为0.3%和3.3%），且公众对癌症的认知不足，研究旨在通过技术手段提高筛查率和癌症知识普及。

Method: 使用决策树分类和支持向量机分类算法分别预测宫颈癌和乳腺癌的易感性，并开发系统根据用户位置推荐最近的医院或癌症治疗中心，同时整合健康卡以维护医疗记录。

Result: 通过模型和系统设计，研究为提升癌症筛查率和公众意识提供了技术解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究通过技术手段推动癌症筛查和知识普及，有助于降低Telangana地区的癌症死亡率并提高公众健康素养。

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

### [3] [Balancing the cellular budget: lessons in metabolism from microbes to cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20776)
*B. Vibishan,Mohit Kumar Jolly,Akshit Goyal*

Main category: q-bio.SC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了癌细胞偏好糖酵解代谢（Warburg效应）的原因，提出代谢优化可能涉及多目标权衡，而非单纯追求生长速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Warburg效应的基础及其在癌细胞中的普遍性，试图通过比较正常生理和微生物代谢来揭示其优化机制。

Method: 通过文献综述，结合正常哺乳动物生理和微生物代谢的类似现象，分析代谢优化的多目标性。

Result: 发现代谢偏好糖酵解可能与生长速率无关，而是多目标优化的结果，提出资源分配框架作为研究工具。

Conclusion: 资源分配框架结合动态系统建模，有望为细胞代谢策略的选择提供新见解。

Abstract: Cancer cells are often seen to prefer glycolytic metabolism over oxidative
phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen-a phenomenon termed the Warburg
effect. Despite significant strides in the decades since its discovery, a clear
basis is yet to be established for the Warburg effect and why cancer cells show
such a preference for aerobic glycolysis. In this review, we draw on what is
known about similar metabolic shifts both in normal mammalian physiology and
overflow metabolism in microbes to shed new light on whether aerobic glycolysis
in cancer represents some form of optimisation of cellular metabolism. From
microbes to cancer, we find that metabolic shifts favouring glycolysis are
sometimes driven by the need for faster growth, but the growth rate is by no
means a universal goal of optimal metabolism. Instead, optimisation goals at
the cellular level are often multi-faceted and any given metabolic state must
be considered in the context of both its energetic costs and benefits over a
range of environmental contexts. For this purpose, we identify the conceptual
framework of resource allocation as a potential testbed for the investigation
of the cost-benefit balance of cellular metabolic strategies. Such a framework
is also readily integrated with dynamical systems modelling, making it a
promising avenue for new answers to the age-old question of why cells, from
cancers to microbes, choose the metabolic strategies they do.
