This makes\nthe characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their\nactivity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that\nrequire linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging\ngaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)\ndiscovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from\nmicro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining\nparticle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary\nexperiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate\nfive state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of\ncalcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated\non both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal\nvariations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods\naccurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE\ndiscovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from\nmicroscopic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDE\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u8868\u5f81\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7PDE\u53d1\u73b0\u586b\u8865\u5fae\u89c2\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u548cPDE\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cdPDE\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9499\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u6269\u6563\u9879\uff0c\u8868\u660ePDE\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4ece\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u6355\u6349\u5b8f\u89c2\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "PDE\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite significant strides in the decades since its discovery, a clear\nbasis is yet to be established for the Warburg effect and why cancer cells show\nsuch a preference for aerobic glycolysis. In this review, we draw on what is\nknown about similar metabolic shifts both in normal mammalian physiology and\noverflow metabolism in microbes to shed new light on whether aerobic glycolysis\nin cancer represents some form of optimisation of cellular metabolism. From\nmicrobes to cancer, we find that metabolic shifts favouring glycolysis are\nsometimes driven by the need for faster growth, but the growth rate is by no\nmeans a universal goal of optimal metabolism. Instead, optimisation goals at\nthe cellular level are often multi-faceted and any given metabolic state must\nbe considered in the context of both its energetic costs and benefits over a\nrange of environmental contexts. For this purpose, we identify the conceptual\nframework of resource allocation as a potential testbed for the investigation\nof the cost-benefit balance of cellular metabolic strategies.
