Abstract: Accurate prediction of cancer type and primary tumor site is critical for
effective diagnosis, personalized treatment, and improved outcomes. Traditional
models struggle with the complexity of genomic and clinical data, but quantum
computing offers enhanced computational capabilities. This study develops a
hybrid quantum-classical transformer model, incorporating quantum attention
mechanisms via variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to improve prediction
accuracy. Using 30,000 anonymized cancer samples from the Genome Warehouse
(GWH), data preprocessing included cleaning, encoding, and feature selection.
Classical self-attention modules were replaced with quantum attention layers,
with classical data encoded into quantum states via amplitude encoding. The
model, trained using hybrid backpropagation and quantum gradient calculations,
outperformed the classical transformer model, achieving 92.8% accuracy and an
AUC of 0.96 compared to 87.5% accuracy and an AUC of 0.89. It also demonstrated
35% faster training and 25% fewer parameters, highlighting computational
efficiency. These findings showcase the potential of quantum-enhanced
transformers to advance biomedical data analysis, enabling more accurate
diagnostics and personalized medicine.

Conclusion: MSH滑动钳的多状态扩散动态反映了其构象变化，表明扩散机制比传统认知更复杂。

Abstract: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is the essential mechanism for preserving genomic
integrity in various living organisms. In this process, MutS homologs (MSH)
play crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting
downstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and
diffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while
traversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans
DNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing
a mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding
clamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the
sliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the
diffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle
tracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling
framework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the
diffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion
mechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct
diffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These
states alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly
involving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest
and the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics
reflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp,
highlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.
