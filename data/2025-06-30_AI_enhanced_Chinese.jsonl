In this process, MutS homologs (MSH)\nplay crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting\ndownstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and\ndiffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while\ntraversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans\nDNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing\na mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding\nclamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the\nsliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the\ndiffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle\ntracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling\nframework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the\ndiffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion\nmechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct\ndiffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These\nstates alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly\ninvolving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest\nand the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics\nreflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp,\nhighlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ATP\u7ed3\u5408\u7684MSH\u6ed1\u52a8\u94b3\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3aMSH\u6ed1\u52a8\u94b3\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790ATP\u7ed3\u5408\u7684MSH\u6ed1\u52a8\u94b3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0MSH\u6ed1\u52a8\u94b3\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5404\u5177\u7279\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u6001\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "MSH\u6ed1\u52a8\u94b3\u7684\u591a\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5176\u6784\u8c61\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3002"}}
