TL;DR: 论文指出单细胞扰动响应模型的性能常被简单预测数据集均值超越，原因是控制参考的delta和未加权误差指标存在缺陷。作者提出DEG感知的加权指标和性能基线，显著提升了模型评估和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示现有单细胞扰动响应模型评估中的缺陷，即控制参考偏差和稀疏生物信号导致模式崩溃，从而提出更准确的评估方法。

Method: 通过大规模模拟和真实数据集分析，提出加权均方误差（WMSE）和加权delta R²（R²w(Δ)）指标，并引入正负性能基线。

Result: 新指标显著降低了均值基线的性能，同时正确奖励了真实预测模型。使用WMSE作为损失函数减少了模式崩溃并提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的DEG感知加权指标和性能基线有效解决了现有评估方法的缺陷，提升了单细胞扰动响应模型的评估和性能。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response
are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this
anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error
metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological
signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of
two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not
genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We
introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted
mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with
respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high
sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines
to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to
null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we
show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves
model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索聚合物复合电纺纳米纤维的界面性能、双电层电容和生物相容性，以用于生物医学应用。

Method: 通过电纺技术制备含Fe2O3和MnZn铁氧体纳米颗粒的聚丙烯腈纳米纤维，并利用FTIR、XPS、HR-SEM、XRD和AGFM等技术表征。

Result: 纳米颗粒的加入改变了纤维的热学、光谱和形态特性，XPS显示热处理后氧化和石墨碳含量增加，磁性表征显示其可用于生物医学操控，细胞相容性良好。

Conclusion: PAN-磁性纳米纤维在靶向给药、MRI和磁热疗等生物医学应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of advanced
polymeric composite electrospun nanofibers (NFs) containing magnetic oxide
nanoparticles (NPs). By leveraging the method of electrospinning, the research
aims to investigate polymer composites with enhanced interfacial properties,
improved double-layer capacitance, and adequate biocompatibility. Electrospun
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs embedded with Fe2O3 and MnZn ferrite NPs were
comprehensively characterized using advanced techniques, i.e., Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
and alternating gradient field magnetometry (AGFM). The incorporation of metal
oxide NPs led to significant changes in the thermal, spectroscopic, and
morphological properties of the NFs. XPS analysis confirmed increased
oxidation, graphitic carbon content, and the formation of new nitrogen
functionalities after heat treatment. Furthermore, interactions between nitrile
groups and metal ions were observed, indicating the influence of nanoparticles
on surface chemistry. Magnetic characterization demonstrated the potential of
these composite NFs to generate magnetic fields for biomedical manipulation.
Cytocompatibility studies revealed no significant impact on the viability or
morphology of human mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting their
biocompatibility. These findings suggest the promising use of PAN-magnetic NFs
in applications including targeted drug administration, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment.

TL;DR: PubChemQCR是一个大规模分子弛豫轨迹数据集，用于训练和评估机器学习原子间势（MLIPs），旨在实现DFT级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DFT计算成本高的问题，同时需要高质量数据集以开发准确且可迁移的MLIPs。

Method: 从PubChemQC项目的几何优化输出中提取数据，构建包含约350万轨迹和3亿分子构象的数据集。

Result: 提供了基准测试结果，评估了9种代表性MLIP模型。

Conclusion: PubChemQCR为MLIPs的发展提供了重要资源，支持高效大规模原子模拟。

Abstract: Computational quantum chemistry plays a critical role in drug discovery,
chemical synthesis, and materials science. While first-principles methods, such
as density functional theory (DFT), provide high accuracy in modeling
electronic structures and predicting molecular properties, they are
computationally expensive. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have
emerged as promising surrogate models that aim to achieve DFT-level accuracy
while enabling efficient large-scale atomistic simulations. The development of
accurate and transferable MLIPs requires large-scale, high-quality datasets
with both energy and force labels. Critically, MLIPs must generalize not only
to stable geometries but also to intermediate, non-equilibrium conformations
encountered during atomistic simulations. In this work, we introduce
PubChemQCR, a large-scale dataset of molecular relaxation trajectories curated
from the raw geometry optimization outputs of the PubChemQC project. PubChemQCR
is the largest publicly available dataset of DFT-based relaxation trajectories
for small organic molecules, comprising approximately 3.5 million trajectories
and over 300 million molecular conformations computed at various levels of
theory. Each conformation is labeled with both total energy and atomic forces,
making the dataset suitable for training and evaluating MLIPs. To provide
baselines for future developments, we benchmark nine representative MLIP models
on the dataset. Our resources are publicly available at

microenvironment. Here we review the role of AI in spatial omics, discussing
the current state-of-the-art and further needs to decipher cancer biology from
large-scale spatial tissue data. An overarching challenge is the development of
interpretable spatial AI models, an activity which demands not only improved
data integration, but also new conceptual frameworks. We discuss emerging
paradigms, in particular data-driven spatial AI, constraint-based spatial AI,
and mechanistic spatial modeling, as well as the importance of integrating AI
with hypothesis-driven strategies and model systems to realize the value of
cancer spatial information.

### [5] [Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23496)
*Praful Gagrani,Nino Lauber,Eric Smith,Christoph Flamm*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 提出了一种热力学形式主义，用于在固定通量电流下对化学反应网络（CRN）路径进行排序，并定义了热力学成本函数，分析了其在平衡和非平衡状态下的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应网络（CRN）因其组合性适用于复杂系统建模，但缺乏对路径热力学成本的量化方法。

Method: 基于大偏差理论定义热力学成本函数，分解为维持非平衡稳态（NESS）的维护成本和限制成本，分析其在平衡和非平衡状态下的变化。

Result: 在平衡附近，CRN的阻力随支持通量电流的反应增加而降低；在远离平衡时，多分子CRN可能为更受限路径分配更低成本。

Conclusion: 该形式主义可能解释酶家族进化中路径选择与特异性优化的关系。

Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling
complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for
analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work
presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed
throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the
system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the
stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for
pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which
decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a
non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the
ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway.
Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response
regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added
that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the
restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded
below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from
equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more
restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be
found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at
far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a
network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have
implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms
may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis,
but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention,
and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.

### [6] [Time-structured models of population growth in fluctuating environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23380)
*Pradeep Pillai,Tarik C. Gouhier*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间结构化模型（TSMs），用于更准确地预测环境变化下的种群动态，解决了传统非时间结构化模型（nTSMs）因忽略历史环境效应而导致的误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人口统计模型忽略世代间环境历史的差异，无法准确预测气候变化下的种群动态，导致误差。

Method: 引入时间结构化模型（TSMs），将种群按历史环境暴露划分为不同队列，模拟环境变化的历史效应。

Result: TSMs比传统nTSMs在波动温度下更准确地估计种群动态，误差显著降低。

Conclusion: TSMs是预测多变环境中种群增长的关键工具。

Abstract: 1. Although environmental variability is expected to play a more prominent
role under climate change, current demographic models that ignore the
differential environmental histories of cohorts across generations are unlikely
to accurately predict population dynamics and growth. The use of these
approaches, which we collectively refer to as non time-structured models or
nTSMs, will instead yield error-prone estimates by giving rise to a form of
ecological memory loss due to their inability to account for the historical
effects of past environmental exposure on subsequent growth rates.
  2. To address this important issue, we introduce a new class of
time-structured models or TSMs that accurately depict growth under variable
environments by splitting seemingly homogeneous populations into distinct
demographic cohorts based on their past exposure to environmental fluctuations.
By accounting for this cryptic population structure, TSMs accurately simulate
the historical effects of environmental variability, even when individuals
exhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity.
  3. Here, we provide a conceptual framework, the mathematical tools needed to
simulate any TSM, and a closed form solution for simple exponential growth. We
then show that traditional nTSMs yield large errors compared to TSMs when
estimating population dynamics under fluctuating temperatures. Overall, TSMs
represent a critical tool for predicting population growth in a variable world.

### [7] [Optimizing information transmission in the canonical Wnt pathway](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22633)

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: 研究通过光遗传学控制Wnt通路，探索细胞群体如何可靠传递外部信号信息，并确定最大化信息传输的最优编码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞群体在分子信号传导中存在噪声和个体差异，限制了其集体决策的可靠性。

Method: 利用光遗传学控制Wnt通路，系统分析信号编码策略，并通过解码映射可视化性能。

Result: 发现离散信号编码可实现超过1比特的信息容量，且最优编码随噪声减少而增加离散信号数量。

Conclusion: 光遗传学Wnt信号可实现超越简单二元开关的调控，为单细胞实验提供了信息处理框架。

Abstract: Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external
signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by
both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual
cells. In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as
an example to study how reliably information about an external signal is
transmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding
strategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene
expression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond
1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals. By averaging
over an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective
noise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding
comprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be
fine-tuned. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the
small-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior.
We visualize the performance of signal encodings using decoding maps. Our
results suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond
a simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from
information processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物序列设计中，生成模型可以高效探索具有理想特性的序列空间，但缺乏归因方法阻碍了从模型中提取可解释的生物学见解。

Method: 开发了基于集成梯度的生成归因度量分析（GAMA），并通过合成数据集和实验抗体-抗原结合数据验证其有效性。

Result: GAMA能够恢复生物学相关特征，并验证生成序列设计策略，无需负训练数据。

Conclusion: GAMA为生成模型提供了可解释性，支持生物序列设计策略的验证。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic
design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched
for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require
both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be
trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity
antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where
negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the
lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to
extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this
gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution
method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We
assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize
its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically
relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it
to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model
interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies
without the need for negative training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞研究中，传统方法和现有VAEs在建模层次数据时存在计算成本高、性能不足、生成能力有限和稳定性差的问题。

Method: HDTree通过统一的层次码本和量化扩散过程建模树节点转换，消除了分支特定模块，提高了稳定性和生成能力。

Result: 在通用和单细胞数据集上，HDTree在准确性和性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HDTree为层次谱系分析提供了新工具，提升了细胞分化路径建模的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell
differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological
processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that
represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face
limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,
and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing
these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree
branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical
relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based
approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a
hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized
diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves
stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative
capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion
process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both
general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods
in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool
for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient
modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream
biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学纤维传感在生物标志物检测中具有潜力，但分子识别与折射率变化的关联仍具挑战性。COVID-19诊断需要更灵敏的方法。

Method: 使用金涂层TFBG平台，通过DNA适配体功能化光纤表面，结合DNA纳米结构（如DNA四面体）增强信号。

Conclusion: 该研究为高性能光学纤维传感平台的发展提供了新思路，结合DNA纳米结构界面可促进生物标志物识别。

Abstract: Optical fiber sensing carries a number of potential advantages for
diagnostics and biomarker detection and monitoring, yet particular challenges
persist in linking molecular recognition events to a change in the refractive
index. DNA aptamers carry particular advantages as functional surface molecules
on optical fibers to tailor detection of specific biomolecules, yet challenges
persist around sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosis of COVID-19 through
detection of nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV-2 provides a classic
diagnostic challenge where optical fiber-based sensing could complement and
improve on typical detection methods such as RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing.
In this study, a plasmonic gold-coated tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG)-based
optical biosensing platform was developed for ultrasensitive detection of
SARS-CoV-2 N protein. By functionalizing the optical fiber surface with
aptamers for the molecular recognition of N protein, changes in refractive
index measured biomolecular binding, thereby achieving real-time, label-free
detection. Additionally, integrating DNA nanostructures such as the DNA
tetrahedron with aptamers significantly enhanced detection sensitivity,
increasing signal intensity ~2.5 times compared to aptamers alone. This study
provides new insights into the development of high-performance optical fiber
sensing platforms which integrate DNA nanostructure interfaces to facilitate
biomarker recognition and sensing.
