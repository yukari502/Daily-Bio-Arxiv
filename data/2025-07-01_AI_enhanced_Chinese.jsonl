This work\npresents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed\nthroughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the\nsystem), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the\nstipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for\npathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which\ndecomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a\nnon-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the\nongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway.\nApplying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response\nregime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added\nthat support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the\nrestriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded\nbelow by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from\nequilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more\nrestricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be\nfound that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at\nfar-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a\nnetwork at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have\nimplications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms\nmay first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis,\nbut later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention,\nand more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u901a\u91cf\u7535\u6d41\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CRN\uff09\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CRN\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6210\u672c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u5b9a\u4e49\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ef4\u6301\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u6001\uff08NESS\uff09\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9650\u5236\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u9644\u8fd1\uff0cCRN\u7684\u963b\u529b\u968f\u652f\u6301\u901a\u91cf\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u5728\u8fdc\u79bb\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\uff0c\u591a\u5206\u5b50CRN\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u66f4\u53d7\u9650\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u9176\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Although environmental variability is expected to play a more prominent\nrole under climate change, current demographic models that ignore the\ndifferential environmental histories of cohorts across generations are unlikely\nto accurately predict population dynamics and growth. The use of these\napproaches, which we collectively refer to as non time-structured models or\nnTSMs, will instead yield error-prone estimates by giving rise to a form of\necological memory loss due to their inability to account for the historical\neffects of past environmental exposure on subsequent growth rates.\n  2. To address this important issue, we introduce a new class of\ntime-structured models or TSMs that accurately depict growth under variable\nenvironments by splitting seemingly homogeneous populations into distinct\ndemographic cohorts based on their past exposure to environmental fluctuations.\nBy accounting for this cryptic population structure, TSMs accurately simulate\nthe historical effects of environmental variability, even when individuals\nexhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity.\n  3. Here, we provide a conceptual framework, the mathematical tools needed to\nsimulate any TSM, and a closed form solution for simple exponential growth. We\nthen show that traditional nTSMs yield large errors compared to TSMs when\nestimating population dynamics under fluctuating temperatures.

DNA aptamers carry particular advantages as functional surface molecules\non optical fibers to tailor detection of specific biomolecules, yet challenges\npersist around sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosis of COVID-19 through\ndetection of nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV-2 provides a classic\ndiagnostic challenge where optical fiber-based sensing could complement and\nimprove on typical detection methods such as RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing.\nIn this study, a plasmonic gold-coated tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG)-based\noptical biosensing platform was developed for ultrasensitive detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 N protein. By functionalizing the optical fiber surface with\naptamers for the molecular recognition of N protein, changes in refractive\nindex measured biomolecular binding, thereby achieving real-time, label-free\ndetection. Additionally, integrating DNA nanostructures such as the DNA\ntetrahedron with aptamers significantly enhanced detection sensitivity,\nincreasing signal intensity ~2.5 times compared to aptamers alone.
