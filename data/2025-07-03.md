### [1] [Characterizing control between interacting subsystems with deep Jacobian estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01946)
*Adam J. Eisen,Mitchell Ostrow,Sarthak Chandra,Leo Kozachkov,Earl K. Miller,Ila R. Fiete*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种非线性控制理论框架JacobianODE，用于从时间序列数据中学习子系统间的控制关系，并在高维混沌系统中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性方法无法描述非线性复杂系统中的子系统控制关系，需要一种数据驱动的非线性方法。

Method: 开发了JacobianODE，一种深度学习方法，直接从数据中估计任意动态系统的Jacobian矩阵。

Result: JacobianODE在高维混沌系统中优于现有方法，并在多区域RNN中展示了学习过程中感官区对认知区控制增强的现象。

Conclusion: 为生物子系统间相互作用提供了理论支持的数据驱动理解框架。

Abstract: Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple
subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory
networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to
model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between
them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the
subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the
directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between
subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically
linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by
nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven
nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions
via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning
Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning
method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for
arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs
outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,
including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area
recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we
show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area
over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the
trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the
foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of
interactions among biological subsystems.

### [3] [Efficient stochastic simulation of gene regulatory networks using hybrid models of transcriptional bursting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01922)
*Mathilde Gaillard,Ulysse Herbach*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的模拟方法，用于高效模拟基因表达的随机性，特别是转录爆发现象，降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞数据揭示了相同基因组和环境下的细胞间存在生物随机性，尤其是转录爆发现象。现有的模拟方法如SSA计算成本高，而PDMPs模型又难以普及。

Method: 提出了一种简单的模拟方法，类似于SSA但计算成本更低，适用于描述任意数量相互作用基因的爆发性PDMP模型。

Result: 通过模拟两基因切换开关，发现双峰分布并非由转录爆发本身解释，而是由基因间相互作用产生的不同爆发频率引起。

Conclusion: 新方法为模拟基因表达随机性提供了高效且易于实现的工具，有助于理解细胞间变异的机制。

Abstract: Single-cell data reveal the presence of biological stochasticity between
cells of identical genome and environment, in particular highlighting the
transcriptional bursting phenomenon. To account for this property, gene
expression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical
species are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic
simulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for
realistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on
piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise
for capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to
specialized mathematical communities. With a view to making them more
accessible, we present here a simple simulation method that is reminiscent of
SSA, while allowing for much lower computational cost. We detail the algorithm
for a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and
prove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we
use the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights
the fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained
by transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies
that may emerge from interactions between genes.

### [5] [Spectral Manifold Harmonization for Graph Imbalanced Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01132)
*Brenda Nogueira,Gabe Gomes,Meng Jiang,Nitesh V. Chawla,Nuno Moniz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spectral Manifold Harmonization（SMH）的新方法，用于解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题，通过生成合成样本以保留拓扑特性并关注代表性不足的目标区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据在科学领域中普遍存在，但现有研究在解决不平衡回归问题时忽视了特定目标值范围的重要性，导致模型偏向于平均目标值。

Method: SMH方法通过生成合成图样本，保留拓扑特性，并专注于代表性不足的目标分布区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，SMH在化学和药物发现基准数据集上显著提升了目标域范围的预测性能。

Conclusion: SMH为解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题提供了一种有效方法，特别适用于关注特定目标值范围的科学应用。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often
face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences
focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically
valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we
present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing
this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating
synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on
often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail
in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or
do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average
target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on
chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent
improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

### [6] [An Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Decision Framework for Progressive Multi-Omics Integration in Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01032)
*Nan Mu,Hongbo Yang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种不确定性感知的多视图动态决策框架，用于多组学数据分类，旨在降低测试成本的同时保持高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高通量多组学技术成本高，可能导致资源浪费，因此需要一种方法在减少测试的同时保持准确性。

Method: 在单组学层面，改进神经网络激活函数以生成Dirichlet分布参数，利用主观逻辑量化分类结果的信念质量和不确定性；在多组学层面，基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合异构模态，动态决策机制逐步引入数据。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上评估，50%以上案例仅需单组学数据即可准确分类，减少冗余测试，同时保持与全组学模型相当的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低测试成本的同时，保持了高诊断准确性和生物学洞察力。

Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have
proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early
diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a
significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially
leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we
propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics
data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while
minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the
activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution
parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and
uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of
a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter
captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a
more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ
a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous
modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and
robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are
incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are
utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially
before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our
approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.
In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a
single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our
method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and
preserves essential biological insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1型糖尿病的葡萄糖-胰岛素交互复杂，传统方法在高维参数空间和实时推断中效率低下。

Method: 采用基于神经后验估计的模拟推理方法，捕捉饮食、胰岛素和葡萄糖水平的复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在参数估计和泛化能力上优于传统方法，并提供实时后验推断。

Conclusion: 该方法为1型糖尿病的数字孪生提供了高效、可靠的参数估计解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to
achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly
challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional
methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional
parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them
slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a
Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to
efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and
glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments
demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter
estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time
posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具（如CellProfiler）在自动化、可重复分析方面存在障碍，阻碍了机器学习工作流。

Method: 提取CellProfiler的核心测量功能，设计为模块化、API优先的工具。

Result: cp_measure的特征与CellProfiler高度一致，并能无缝集成到Python生态系统中。

Conclusion: cp_measure支持可重复、自动化的图像分析流程，适用于计算生物学中的机器学习应用。

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

Motivation: 解决现有LLMs和VLMs在生物研究中应用受限的问题，如协议设计僵化、适应性差、错误处理不足和操作复杂。

Method: 采用分层架构：Biologist Agent通过检索增强生成合成协议；Technician Agent将其转化为可执行机器人伪代码；Inspector Agent通过多模态感知和异常检测确保程序完整性。

Result: 系统在细胞传代和培养任务中性能优于或等同于人工操作，并在视网膜色素上皮细胞分化中优于传统策略。

Conclusion: BioMARS展示了通用AI驱动实验室自动化的可行性，以及语言推理在生物研究中的变革性作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have the

Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the
Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the
Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and
anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture
tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and
morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization,
outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment
epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration,
