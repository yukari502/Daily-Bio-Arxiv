To account for this property, gene\nexpression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical\nspecies are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic\nsimulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for\nrealistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on\npiecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise\nfor capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to\nspecialized mathematical communities.

Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness.

A common approach to understanding these systems is to\nmodel the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between\nthem. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the\nsubsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the\ndirectionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between\nsubsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically\nlinear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by\nnonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven\nnonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions\nvia the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning\nJacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning\nmethod that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for\narbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs\noutperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,\nincluding high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we\nshow that the \"sensory\" area gains greater control over the \"cognitive\" area\nover learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the\ntrained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior.

However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a\nsignificant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially\nleading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our\napproach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.\nIn three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a\nsingle omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing.
