Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed\nmanually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective.

Additionally, as\nendothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may\nnot fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed\ntubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture\nand maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired\nusing phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three\nindependent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics\nincluded tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel\ncircularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis\nmaturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image\ndiffered significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker\n(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count\n(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node\ncount (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across\nangiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,\nand circularity (all p<0.0001).
