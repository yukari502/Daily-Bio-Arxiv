Abstract: Predicting drug responses using genetic and transcriptomic features is
crucial for enhancing personalized medicine. In this study, we implemented an
ensemble of machine learning algorithms to analyze the correlation between
genetic and transcriptomic features of cancer cell lines and IC50 values, a
reliable metric for drug efficacy. Our analysis involved a reduction of the
feature set from an original pool of 38,977 features, demonstrating a strong
linear relationship between genetic features and drug responses across various
algorithms, including SVR, Linear Regression, and Ridge Regression. Notably,
copy number variations (CNVs) emerged as more predictive than mutations,
suggesting a significant reevaluation of biomarkers for drug response
prediction. Through rigorous statistical methods, we identified a highly
reduced set of 421 critical features. This set offers a novel perspective that
contrasts with traditional cancer driver genes, underscoring the potential for
these biomarkers in designing targeted therapies. Furthermore, our findings
advocate for IC50 values as a predictable measurement of drug responses and
underscore the need for more data that can represent the dimensionality of
genomic data in drug response prediction. Future work will aim to expand the
dataset and refine feature selection to enhance the generalizability of the
predictive model in clinical settings.

Result: tubuleTracker分析速度最快（6秒/图像），且其指标（如管状结构数量、长度、节点数等）与血管生成成熟度显著相关。

Conclusion: tubuleTracker比手动和ImageJ分析更快、更一致，尤其是血管圆形度能有效反映成熟度，已作为免费共享软件提供。

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

### [3] [Leveraging Transformer Models to Capture Multi-Scale Dynamics in Biomolecules by nano-GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02734)
*Wenqi Zeng,Lu Zhang,Yuan Yao*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为nano-GPT的深度学习模型，用于捕捉分子系统中的长期动态行为，通过两阶段训练机制减少误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以模拟分子系统的长期动态行为，且现有语言模型（如LSTM）受限于低维反应坐标。

Method: 基于GPT架构设计nano-GPT，采用两阶段训练机制逐步替换分子动力学标记，减少误差。

Result: 在三种不同系统中验证了nano-GPT的有效性，能够捕捉长期动态行为。

Conclusion: nano-GPT为理解复杂生物分子过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: Long-term biomolecular dynamics are critical for understanding key
evolutionary transformations in molecular systems. However, capturing these
processes requires extended simulation timescales that often exceed the
practical limits of conventional models. To address this, shorter simulations,
initialized with diverse perturbations, are commonly used to sample phase space
and explore a wide range of behaviors. Recent advances have leveraged language
models to infer long-term behavior from short trajectories, but methods such as
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are constrained to low-dimensional
reaction coordinates, limiting their applicability to complex systems. In this
work, we present nano-GPT, a novel deep learning model inspired by the GPT
architecture, specifically designed to capture long-term dynamics in molecular
systems with fine-grained conformational states and complex transitions. The
model employs a two-pass training mechanism that incrementally replaces
molecular dynamics (MD) tokens with model-generated predictions, effectively
mitigating accumulation errors inherent in the training window. We validate
nano-GPT on three distinct systems: a four-state model potential, the alanine
dipeptide, a well-studied simple molecule, and the Fip35 WW domain, a complex
biomolecular system. Our results show that nano-GPT effectively captures
long-timescale dynamics by learning high-order dependencies through attention
mechanism, offering a novel perspective for interpreting biomolecular
processes.

### [4] [The Basic Reproduction Number for Petri Net Models: A Next-Generation Matrix Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02344)
*Trevor Reckell,Beckett Sterner,Petar Jevtić*

Main category: math.AT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从Petri网模型中计算基本再生数（R_0）的通用方法，并展示了如何将ODE模型中的下一代算法应用于Petri网模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Petri网模型在流行病学中应用广泛，但缺乏直接计算R_0的通用方法。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种通用方法，将下一代算法从ODE模型扩展到Petri网模型，并通过多个SIR型Petri网模型示例验证。

Result: 成功实现了从Petri网模型计算R_0的方法，并展示了其适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为流行病学中的Petri网模型提供了计算R_0的工具，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: The basic reproduction number (R_0) is an epidemiological metric that
represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious
individual in a completely susceptible population. The methodology for
calculating this metric is well-defined for numerous model types, including,
most prominently, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The basic
reproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an
outbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to
inform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the
spread of diseases. A Petri net (PN) is a directed bipartite graph where
places, transitions, arcs, and the firing of the arcs determine the dynamic
behavior of the system. Petri net models have been an increasingly used tool
within the epidemiology community. However, a generalized method for
calculating R_0 directly from PN models has not been established. Thus, in this
paper, we present a general method for calculating R_0 for Petri nets.
Additionally, we show how a computational method implementing the
next-generation algorithm in ODE models can also be applied to Petri net
models. We also provide multiple examples of how to use this approach to
calculate 0 for various SIR-type Petri net models.

### [5] [A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02367)
*Christian Salomonsen,Luigi Tommaso Luppino,Fredrik Aspheim,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Elisabeth Wetzer,Michael Kampffmeyer,Rodrigo Berzaghi,Rune Sundset,Robert Jenssen,Samuel Kuttner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的非侵入性方法（FC-DLIF），用于从小动物动态PET图像中预测输入函数，避免传统动脉采血的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动脉采血在小动物研究中复杂且不可重复，阻碍纵向研究。

Method: FC-DLIF模型通过空间和时间特征提取器直接从PET图像预测输入函数。

Result: 模型在[$^{18}$F]FDG数据上表现可靠，但对未训练的其他示踪剂数据预测失败。

Conclusion: FC-DLIF为非侵入性输入函数预测提供了可靠且灵活的替代方案。

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.
