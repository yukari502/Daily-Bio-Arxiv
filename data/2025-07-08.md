### [1] [AuraGenome: An LLM-Powered Framework for On-the-Fly Reusable and Scalable Circular Genome Visualizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02877)
*Chi Zhang,Yu Dong,Yang Wang,Yuetong Han,Guihua Shan,Bixia Tang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: AuraGenome是一个基于LLM的框架，用于快速生成多层环形基因组可视化，解决了现有工具复杂且易出错的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基因组可视化工具需要复杂脚本和手动配置，耗时且易错，AuraGenome旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 结合语义驱动的多智能体工作流和交互式可视化分析系统，使用七个LLM驱动的智能体完成从数据到可视化的转换。

Result: 支持多种环形布局，实现交互和配置重用，并通过案例研究和用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AuraGenome提供了一种高效、可扩展的基因组可视化解决方案。

Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural
variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex
scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce
AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable
generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines
a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics
system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned
distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code
generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The
system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering
ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular
genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration
reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export.
We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user
study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

### [2] [Modeling Gene Expression Distributional Shifts for Unseen Genetic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02980)
*Kalyan Ramakrishnan,Jonathan G. Hedley,Sisi Qu,Puneet K. Dokania,Philip H. S. Torr,Cesar A. Prada-Medina,Julien Fauqueur,Kaspar Martens*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种神经网络模型，用于预测基因扰动后的表达分布，优于现有方法，且成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅预测基因表达的平均变化，忽略了单细胞数据的随机性，而该研究旨在提供更真实的细胞响应模型。

Method: 通过训练神经网络预测基因表达分布（如直方图），并结合大型语言模型的基因嵌入知识以泛化到未见过的扰动。

Result: 模型在捕捉高阶统计量（如方差、偏度和峰度）方面优于基线，同时在预测平均表达变化方面仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更具表达力和生物学信息量的扰动效应模型提供了实用方法。

Abstract: We train a neural network to predict distributional responses in gene
expression following genetic perturbations. This is an essential task in
early-stage drug discovery, where such responses can offer insights into gene
function and inform target identification. Existing methods only predict
changes in the mean expression, overlooking stochasticity inherent in
single-cell data. In contrast, we offer a more realistic view of cellular
responses by modeling expression distributions. Our model predicts gene-level
histograms conditioned on perturbations and outperforms baselines in capturing
higher-order statistics, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, at a
fraction of the training cost. To generalize to unseen perturbations, we
incorporate prior knowledge via gene embeddings from large language models
(LLMs). While modeling a richer output space, the method remains competitive in
predicting mean expression changes. This work offers a practical step towards
more expressive and biologically informative models of perturbation effects.

### [3] [Finding easy regions for short-read variant calling from pangenome data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03718)
*Heng Li*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 通过高质量人类基因组数据，研究者开发了一套样本无关的“简单区域”集合，用于提高短读长变异检测的准确性，覆盖率高且适用于临床和研究样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有短读长变异检测的基准测试仅适用于预定义的置信区域，导致在无此类区域的样本中错误率显著增加。现有解决方案未能考虑非参考样本或存在偏向性。

Method: 利用数百个高质量人类基因组组装数据，推导出一套样本无关的简单区域，这些区域在短读长变异检测中表现出高准确性。

Result: 这些区域覆盖了GRCh38的87.9%、编码区的92.7%和ClinVar致病变异的96.4%，在覆盖范围和易用性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该资源为临床或研究样本提供了一种便捷且高效的方法，用于过滤虚假变异检测结果。

Abstract: Background: While benchmarks on short-read variant calling suggest low error
rate below 0.5%, they are only applicable to predefined confident regions. For
a human sample without such regions, the error rate could be 10 times higher.
Although multiple sets of easy regions have been identified to alleviate the
issue, they fail to consider non-reference samples or are biased towards
existing short-read data or aligners.
  Results: Here, using hundreds of high-quality human assemblies, we derived a
set of sample-agnostic easy regions where short-read variant calling reaches
high accuracy. These regions cover 87.9% of GRCh38, 92.7% of coding regions and
96.4% of ClinVar pathogenic variants. They achieve a good balance between
coverage and easiness and can be generated for other human assemblies or
species with multiple well assembled genomes.
  Conclusion: This resource provides a convient and powerful way to filter
spurious variant calls for clinical or research human samples.

### [4] [Human-Guided Feature Selection for Accurate Cardiomyocyte Dysfunction Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03023)

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种特征选择方法，用于从心肌细胞松弛和钙动力学数据中识别关键特征，以早期检测舒张性心力衰竭中的心肌细胞功能障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别心肌细胞功能障碍对舒张性心力衰竭的预后至关重要，但由于数据复杂性和冗余性，提取关键特征具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了一个特征选择流程，结合统计显著性测试、层次聚类和随机森林分类，从心肌细胞松弛和钙动力学数据中筛选最具信息量的特征。

Result: 通过优化的特征集，随机森林分类器性能与完整特征集相当，优于基于PCA的方法，同时保留了生物相关性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，少量精心选择的生物特征可以有效检测心肌细胞功能障碍的早期迹象。

Abstract: Early identification of cardiomyocyte dysfunction is a critical challenge for
the prognosis of diastolic heart failure (DHF) exhibiting impaired left
ventricular relaxation (ILVR). Myocardial relaxation relies strongly on
efficient intracellular calcium (${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$) handling. During diastole,
a sluggish removal of ${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$ from cardiomyocytes disrupts sarcomere
relaxation, leading to ILVR \textit{at the organ level}. Characterizing
myocardial relaxation \textit{at the cellular level} requires analyzing both
sarcomere length (SL) transients and intracellular calcium kinetics (CK).
However, due to the complexity and redundancy in SL and CK data, identifying
the most informative features for accurate classification is challenging. To
address this, we developed a robust feature selection pipeline involving
statistical significance testing (p-values), hierarchical clustering, and
feature importance evaluation using random forest (RF) classification to select
the most informative features from SL and CK data. SL and CK transients were
obtained from prior studies involving a transgenic phospho-ablated mouse model
exhibiting ILVR (AAA mice) and wild-type as non-transgenic control mice (NTG).
By iteratively refining the feature set, we trained a RF classifier using the
selected reduced features. For comparison, we evaluated the performance of the
classifier using the full set of original features as well as a dimensionally
reduced set derived through principal component analysis (PCA). The confusion
matrices demonstrated that the reduced feature set achieved comparable
performance to the full feature set and outperformed the PCA-based approach,
while offering better interpretability by retaining biologically relevant
features. These findings suggest that a small, carefully chosen set of
biological features can effectively detect early signs of cardiomyocyte
dysfunction.

### [5] [Enhancing Swarms Durability to Threats via Graph Signal Processing and GNN-based Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03039)
*Jonathan Karin,Zoe Piran,Mor Nitzan*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文通过图信号处理技术分析群体稳定性，揭示了群体在逃避检测与抗捕食能力之间的权衡，并提出了基于图神经网络的生成模型SwaGen以优化群体配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究外部扰动（如环境变化、捕食者或通信故障）对群体稳定性的影响，填补了现有研究中对这一问题的理解空白。

Method: 将群体建模为图，应用图信号处理技术分析扰动；提出基于图神经网络的生成模型SwaGen，通过任务特定的损失函数优化群体配置。

Result: 揭示了群体在逃避检测与抗捕食能力之间的“可检测性-耐久性权衡”，并通过SwaGen生成了优化这一权衡的新型空间配置。

Conclusion: SwaGen模型可用于设计鲁棒的人工群体，并深化对自然群体动态的理解。

Abstract: Swarms, such as schools of fish or drone formations, are prevalent in both
natural and engineered systems. While previous works have focused on the social
interactions within swarms, the role of external perturbations--such as
environmental changes, predators, or communication breakdowns--in affecting
swarm stability is not fully understood. Our study addresses this gap by
modeling swarms as graphs and applying graph signal processing techniques to
analyze perturbations as signals on these graphs. By examining predation, we
uncover a "detectability-durability trade-off", demonstrating a tension between
a swarm's ability to evade detection and its resilience to predation, once
detected. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this trade-off,
explicitly tying it to properties of the swarm's spatial configuration. Toward
task-specific optimized swarms, we introduce SwaGen, a graph neural
network-based generative model. We apply SwaGen to resilient swarm generation
by defining a task-specific loss function, optimizing the contradicting
trade-off terms simultaneously.With this, SwaGen reveals novel spatial
configurations, optimizing the trade-off at both ends. Applying the model can
guide the design of robust artificial swarms and deepen our understanding of
natural swarm dynamics.

### [6] [LANTERN: A Machine Learning Framework for Lipid Nanoparticle Transfection Efficiency Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03209)
*Asal Mehradfar,Mohammad Shahab Sepehri,Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato,Glen S. Kwon,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Salman Avestimehr,Morteza Rasoulianboroujeni*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: LANTERN是一种基于机器学习的框架，用于预测脂质纳米颗粒（LNP）的转染效率，通过结合简单的模型和化学信息特征，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高效的RNA递送系统需要新的离子化脂质，但现有预测方法因数据质量、特征表示和准确性不足而受限。

Method: LANTERN结合了Morgan指纹和专家描述符，训练多层感知机模型，并与现有模型AGILE进行对比。

Result: LANTERN在预测转染效率上表现优异（R²=0.8161，r=0.9053），远超AGILE（R²=0.2655，r=0.5488）。

Conclusion: LANTERN为LNP转染预测提供了强大的基准框架，有助于加速脂质基RNA递送系统的设计。

Abstract: The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle
(LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based
therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of
machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular
structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead
identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data
quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor
generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection
Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection
efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse
set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for
transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with
chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints,
outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings,
such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a
combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest
performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE
($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN
consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus,
LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction
and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems
design.

### [7] [SPATIA: Multimodal Model for Prediction and Generation of Spatial Cell Phenotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04704)
*Zhenglun Kong,Mufan Qiu,John Boesen,Xiang Lin,Sukwon Yun,Tianlong Chen,Manolis Kellis,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: SPATIA是一种多尺度生成和预测模型，用于整合细胞形态、基因表达和空间背景，在多个任务中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解细胞形态、基因表达和空间组织如何共同影响组织功能是生物学中的核心挑战。现有方法通常孤立分析这些模态或分辨率有限。

Method: SPATIA通过跨注意力融合细胞形态和转录组数据，并使用Transformer模块在多个尺度上捕获空间依赖性，同时结合生成扩散模型合成高分辨率细胞图像。

Result: SPATIA在12个任务中优于13个现有模型，并能生成反映转录组扰动的真实细胞形态。

Conclusion: SPATIA为整合多模态空间转录组数据提供了统一框架，显著提升了性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial
organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology.
Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution
measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning
methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited
resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware
representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial
context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at
single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to
whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale
generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns
cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and
transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at
niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial
dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion
decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene
expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million
cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs
across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA
against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several
categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,
cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved
performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that
reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

### [8] [The Spatial Regime Conversion Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04937)
*Charles G. Cameron,Cameron A. Smith,Christian A. Yates*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: SRCM是一种新颖的混合建模框架，用于模拟反应-扩散系统，通过自适应结合离散随机和连续确定性表示，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在模拟反应-扩散系统时，要么完全随机（计算成本高），要么完全连续（忽略局部随机性）。SRCM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SRCM扩展了RCM，在低浓度区域使用离散随机模型（RDME），高浓度区域使用连续PDE模型，并根据局部阈值动态切换。

Result: SRCM在多个一维测试系统中验证，能够准确捕捉随机特征，同时显著提高计算效率。

Conclusion: SRCM是一种高效且准确的混合建模方法，适用于需要局部随机性但全局计算效率的系统。

Abstract: We present the spatial regime conversion method (SRCM), a novel hybrid
modelling framework for simulating reaction-diffusion systems that adaptively
combines stochastic discrete and deterministic continuum representations.
Extending the regime conversion method (RCM) to spatial settings, the SRCM
employs a discrete reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) representation in
regions of low concentration and continuum partial differential equations
(PDEs) where concentrations are high, dynamically switching based on local
thresholds. This enables efficient and accurate simulation of systems in which
stochasticity plays a key role but is not required uniformly across the domain.
We specify the full mathematical formulation of the SRCM, including conversion
reactions, hybrid kinetic rules, and consistent numerical updates. The method
is validated across several one-dimensional test systems, including simple
diffusion from a region of high concentration, the formation of a morphogen
gradient, and the propagation of FKPP travelling waves. Results show that the
SRCM captures key stochastic features while offering substantial gains in
computational efficiency over fully stochastic models.

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 研究探索了基因调控电路在时间约束下如何快速区分转录因子浓度差异，发现时间轨迹比总mRNA更能加速决策，并揭示了不同浓度下启动子架构的拓扑特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解基因调控电路在短时间内完成功能时，时间约束对电路架构的限制。

Method: 使用优化框架分析启动子架构，研究其在不同转录因子浓度下的响应特性。

Result: 低浓度下响应低且非协同，高浓度下响应高且协同；快速决策网络在非特异性配体存在时无需最优选择性。

Conclusion: 时间约束下的基因调控电路设计需关注速率限制步骤，而非平衡状态的能量消耗。

Abstract: Cells integrate signals and make decisions about their future state in short
amounts of time. A lot of theoretical effort has gone into asking how to best
design gene regulatory circuits that fulfill a given function, yet little is
known about the constraints that performing that function in a small amount of
time imposes on circuit architectures. Using an optimization framework, we
explore the properties of a class of promoter architectures that distinguish
small differences in transcription factor concentrations under time
constraints. We show that the full temporal trajectory of gene activity allows
for faster decisions than its integrated activity represented by the total
number of transcribed mRNA. The topology of promoter architectures that allow
for rapidly distinguishing low transcription factor concentrations result in a
low, shallow, and non cooperative response, while at high concentrations, the
response is high and cooperative. In the presence of non-cognate ligands,
networks with fast and accurate decision times need not be optimally selective,
especially if discrimination is difficult. While optimal networks are
generically out of equilibrium, the energy associated with that irreversibility
is only modest, and negligible at small concentrations. Instead, our results
highlight the crucial role of rate-limiting steps imposed by biophysical
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在生物医学领域因"幻觉"问题导致准确性不足，小型领域特定模型可能更适合此类高精度需求的任务。

Method: 采用小型BERT架构模型（约1.1亿参数），结合主动学习方案，利用信息熵选择最具信息量的样本进行训练。

Result: 模型在预测结核病相关分子相互作用时达到80%以上准确率，仅需使用25%的数据。高确定性错误样本对提升准确性贡献显著。

Conclusion: 小型领域特定模型在生物医学研究中具有潜力，主动学习策略和高确定性错误样本的选择是关键。

Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming
ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general
purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative
answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in
the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that
the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a
more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In
this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task
of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps
in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt
to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually
curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative
examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a
small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular
interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over
80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in
question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of
new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring
the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty
(lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain
examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning
rate.

Result: 揭示了最优编码方向的特征和临界点的性质，并在信号预测问题中验证了新见解。

Conclusion: 深化了对高斯信息瓶颈方法的理解，为更广泛的非高斯情境提供了探索动机。

Abstract: Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living
and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely
recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information
bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random
variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about
a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the
amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is
numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where
the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution
predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal
representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature
transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived
from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of
their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of
the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching
perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These
perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding
directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of
encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates
between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a
previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how
different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to
enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the
foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian
setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader,
non-Gaussian contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GNNs和Transformers在编码相对位置信息上的差异，探索在位置信息不重要的领域（如单细胞转录组学）中，GNNs是否能替代Transformers。

Method: 通过理论分析和合成示例比较GNNs和Transformers的编码能力，并在单细胞转录组学数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，GNNs在性能上与Transformers相当，同时计算资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: 在位置信息不关键的领域，GNNs可以替代Transformers，为单细胞转录组学等领域提供了新的选择。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

TL;DR: EAMil是一种多实例深度学习框架，利用TCR测序数据高精度诊断SLE和RA，并识别疾病相关基因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TCR库在自身免疫疾病中的临床应用受限于序列稀疏性和低见证率，需要更高效的分析方法。

Method: 结合PrimeSeq特征提取、ESMonehot编码和增强门注意力机制，构建EAMil模型。

Result: 模型在SLE和RA诊断中AUC分别达98.95%和97.76%，能有效区分疾病相关基因和严重程度。

Conclusion: EAMil为自身免疫疾病的检测和分类提供了可解释的新方法，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注孤立的成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物意义PPI网络的能力，这对生物学研究至关重要。

Method: PRING构建了一个高质量、多物种的PPI网络数据集，并设计了两种互补的评估范式：拓扑导向任务和功能导向任务。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's

crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用张量补全方法改进DrugMatrix毒理基因组数据集的补全效果，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过保留数据的3维结构（组织、处理和转录组测量），并利用机器学习方法，改进现有补全效果。

Method: 提出基于张量的方法，包括非负张量补全，优于传统的Canonical Polyadic分解和2维矩阵分解。

Result: 新方法更准确反映原始数据分布，捕捉器官特异性变异，误差更低。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了数据补全精度，还为跨物种药物研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

*Sihan Hou,Zhongfu Wang,Yuting Zhu,Hong Liu,Jiajie Feng*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不同磁场强度对蚯蚓在月球土壤模拟物中行为及土壤改良能力的影响，发现低磁场有助于土壤改良，而高磁场增加蚯蚓氧化应激。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着载人深空任务的发展，月球基地的生物再生生命支持系统（BLSS）面临月球环境因素的挑战，尤其是低磁场的影响尚未明确。

Method: 在三种磁场条件下（月球低磁场、地球磁场和高磁场）测试蚯蚓在月球土壤模拟物与有机废物混合中的表现，分析其氧化应激、土壤改良能力及微生物群落变化。

Result: 低磁场改善了土壤的pH值、养分和腐殖质含量，提高了小麦幼苗率；高磁场增加了蚯蚓的氧化应激并破坏了微生物群落的相互作用。

Conclusion: 研究否定了月球低磁场对蚯蚓-土壤-废物系统的负面影响，为深空BLSS研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: With the advancement of crewed deep-space missions, Bioregenerative Life
Support Systems (BLSS) for lunar bases face stresses from lunar environmental
factors. While microgravity and radiation are well-studied, the low-magnetic
field's effects remain unclear. Earthworms ("soil scavengers") improve lunar
soil simulant and degrade plant waste, as shown in our prior studies. We tested
earthworms in lunar soil simulant mixed with organic waste (from "Lunar Palace
365" experiment) under three magnetic conditions: lunar-low, Earth, and high.
Stronger fields increased earthworm oxidative stress (MDA) and impaired
neurotransmitters. Weaker fields enhanced substrate cultivability: neutralized
pH, increased nutrients, humus, and wheat seedling rate. Microbial analyses
showed: (1) Higher fungal Shannon index under high fields indicated impaired
digestion; (2) More positive correlations in gut networks suggested slower
microbial cooperation (e.g., lignocellulose degradation); (3) Reduced Network
Size, Path Length and Modularity confirmed disrupted interactions. This
disproves lunar low-magnetic stress on earthworm-soil-waste systems, aiding
deep-space BLSS research.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）和冷冻电子断层扫描（cryo-ET）中的确认偏误问题，特别是在粒子挑选阶段，模板匹配和深度神经网络方法可能在纯噪声中产生虚假结构（称为“噪声中的结构”）。作者提出了缓解策略以减少偏误影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确认偏误在冷冻电镜和冷冻电子断层扫描的数据解释中可能导致系统性错误，尤其是在粒子挑选阶段。作者旨在揭示这一问题的严重性并提出解决方案。

Method: 结合理论分析和控制实验，研究了模板匹配和深度神经网络在纯噪声中生成虚假结构的现象。

Result: 发现两种方法在纯噪声中均能产生持久的分子结构，表明当前工作流程存在偏误注入风险。

Conclusion: 研究加深了对确认偏误的理解，并呼吁谨慎解释重建结果，特别是在依赖模板驱动的粒子挑选时。提出了缓解策略以减少偏误影响。

Abstract: Confirmation bias is a fundamental challenge in cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), where prior expectations can
lead to systematic errors in data interpretation. This bias may emerge at
multiple stages of the reconstruction pipeline, and in particular in the
critical particle picking stage, where 2D particles (in cryo-EM) or 3D
subtomograms (in cryo-ET) are extracted from highly noisy micrographs or
tomograms. Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and
deep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled
experiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can
produce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from
noise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows:
the potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven
bias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies
to reduce the impact of such biases. Together, our findings deepen the
theoretical understanding of confirmation bias in cryo-EM and cryo-ET and call
for cautious interpretation of reconstructions, primarily when relying on
template-driven particle picking.

### [18] [Segmentation of separated Lumens in 3D CTA images of Aortic Dissection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03655)
*Christophe Lohou,Bruno Miguel*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用填充撕裂表面的方法分离主动脉夹层中的真假腔，为医生诊断提供视觉辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉夹层是一种严重疾病，需要紧急处理。通过分离真假腔，可以更好地辅助医生诊断。

Method: 使用数学形态学操作和Aktouf闭合算法生成填充撕裂的3D表面，并利用这些表面切断腔间连接。

Result: 成功分离了真假腔，并首次实现了基于填充表面的图像处理操作，为诊断提供了新的视觉工具。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有助于诊断，还可能提升其他研究（如配准、分割和血流动力学分析）。

Abstract: Aortic dissection is a serious pathology and requires an emergency
management. It is characterized by one or more tears of the intimal wall of the
normal blood duct of the aorta (true lumen); the blood under pressure then
creates a second blood lumen (false lumen) in the media tissue. The two lumens
are separated by an intimal wall, called flap. From the segmentation of
connected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection
3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us
to retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and
characterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces
are obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the
framework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the
intimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete
data, it is nevertheless possible to "materialize" them with these 3D filling
surfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these
holes.
  In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections
between lumens in order to separate them.
  This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image
processing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen
separation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic
dissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.
  Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance
several current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).

Abstract: We summarize recent progress on the theory and applications of structural
identifiability of compartmental models. On the applications side, we review
identifiability analyses undertaken recently for models arising in
epidemiology, oncology, and other areas; and we summarize common approaches for
handling models that are unidentifiable. We also highlight recent theoretical
and algorithmic results on how to reparametrize unidentifiable models and, in
the context of linear compartmental models, how to predict identifiability
properties directly from the model structure. Finally, we highlight future
research directions.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数学模型在生物数据分析中的挑战，特别是模型复杂性和非可识别性问题，提出了一种半参数高斯过程方法来处理模型结构不确定性，从而提高参数估计的稳健性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数学模型在生物数据分析中因复杂性和非可识别性导致的参数估计不准确问题，避免因简化模型而引入的模型错误指定风险。

Method: 采用半参数高斯过程方法，将感兴趣参数与模型项的不确定性分开处理，研究广义逻辑增长和空间分辨过程。

Result: 允许模型结构不确定性可以提高参数估计的稳健性和准确性，并更好地量化剩余不确定性。

Conclusion: 讨论了可识别性与模型错误指定之间的联系，并提出了处理模型错误指定的替代方法。

Abstract: Mathematical models are routinely applied to interpret biological data, with
common goals that include both prediction and parameter estimation. A challenge
in mathematical biology, in particular, is that models are often complex and
non-identifiable, while data are limited. Rectifying identifiability through
simplification can seemingly yield more precise parameter estimates, albeit, as
we explore in this perspective, at the potentially catastrophic cost of
introducing model misspecification and poor accuracy. We demonstrate how
uncertainty in model structure can be propagated through to uncertainty in
parameter estimates using a semi-parametric Gaussian process approach that
delineates parameters of interest from uncertainty in model terms.
Specifically, we study generalised logistic growth with an unknown crowding
function, and a spatially resolved process described by a partial differential
equation with a time-dependent diffusivity parameter. Allowing for structural
model uncertainty yields more robust and accurate parameter estimates, and a
better quantification of remaining uncertainty. We conclude our perspective by
discussing the connections between identifiability and model misspecification,
and alternative approaches to dealing with model misspecification in
mathematical biology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物发现方法复杂、成本高、耗时长且失败率高，亟需全面了解AI/ML如何整合到全流程中。

Method: 详细分析了AI/ML在目标识别、先导化合物筛选和优化等核心阶段的应用，并结合案例研究。

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.
