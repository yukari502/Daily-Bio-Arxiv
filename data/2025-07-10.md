Abstract: The mycelium of a filamentous fungus is a growing, branching network of
numerous entangled hyphae exhibiting polarised apical growth. Expansion occurs
during the vegetative phase from a single ascospore, driven by the need to
explore and occupy surrounding space limiting competitors, enhancing nutrient
uptake, and promoting spore dispersal. Radial, rapid, and rectilinear growth
combined with frequent branching appears adaptive. However, passive growth
without interactions or feedback may produce suboptimal networks, as neither
local density nor potential connectivity is considered. Reorientations of the
apex near existing hyphae suggest apex hypha feedback. Yet, the diversity of
behaviours, spontaneous fluctuations, and limited apical trajectories studied
leave open the question of active regulation. To investigate possible apex
hypha interactions, we analyse a dataset of Podospora anserina thallus growth
by reconstructing all apical trajectories postbranching and fitting them with a
classical Langevin model that incorporates potential interactions. Comparing
isolated and nonisolated hyphae trajectories allows to identify a clear
signature of interaction composed of abrupt deceleration and reorientation.
This work opens the path towards a systematic exploration of hyphal
interactions.

Abstract: Quantifying organism-level phenotypes, such as growth dynamics and biomass
accumulation, is fundamental to understanding agronomic traits and optimizing
crop production. However, quality growing data of plants at scale is difficult
to generate. Here we use a mobile robotic platform to capture high-resolution
environmental sensing and phenotyping measurements of a large-scale hydroponic
leafy greens system. We describe a self-supervised modeling approach to build a
map from observed growing data to the entire plant growth trajectory. We
demonstrate our approach by forecasting future plant height and harvest mass of
crops in this system. This approach represents a significant advance in
combining robotic automation and machine learning, as well as providing
actionable insights for agronomic research and operational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的病理基础模型缺乏与单细胞分子数据的整合，限制了其在精准肿瘤学中的应用。

Method: PAST通过训练2000万对病理图像和单细胞转录组数据，学习跨模态的统一表示。

Result: PAST在单细胞基因表达预测、虚拟分子染色和多模态生存分析中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAST为病理基础模型提供了新范式，支持高分辨率空间组学和精准癌症研究。

Abstract: While pathology foundation models have transformed cancer image analysis,
they often lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution,
limiting their utility for precision oncology. Here, we present PAST, a
pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired
histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor
types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene
expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both
spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach
enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular
staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology
slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds
the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability
and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation
models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics,
mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 研究血清25-羟基维生素D浓度与心理健康的关系，发现仅在偏远地区居民中存在显著负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨维生素D与心理健康的关系，特别是对原住民和托雷斯海峡岛民的影响。

Method: 利用2012-2013年澳大利亚原住民和托雷斯海峡岛民健康调查的横断面数据，通过多元线性回归分析血清25(OH)D浓度与K5心理困扰评分的关系。

Result: 总体人群及按性别分层后无显著关联，但在偏远地区居民中，血清25(OH)D浓度与心理困扰呈显著负相关。

Conclusion: 维生素D水平与心理健康的关联仅存在于偏远地区居民，提示需针对该人群制定改善维生素D状态的公共卫生策略。

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25(OH)D] concentration and mental health, measured using the Kessler
Psychological Distress Scale 5 (K5), among Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Peoples. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the 2012-2013
Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey. Multiple linear
regression was used to test the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration
and K5, adjusting for age, sex, education, remoteness, socioeconomic status,
season of blood collection, smoking, and alcohol intake (n = 1,983). We also
stratified the analysis by sex and by remoteness. Results: There was no
statistically significant association between serum 25(OH) concentration and K5
in the total population, nor when stratified by sex. When stratified by
remoteness, higher serum 25(OH)D concentration was statistically significantly
associated with lower K5 scores among those living remotely (adjusted \b{eta}:
-0.18; 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01). Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was
inversely associated with psychological distress only among those living
remotely. Implications for Public Health: Given the prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency and the observed association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and
psychological distress among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples
living remotely, public health strategies to improve vitamin D status among
this population group are warranted.

### [5] [DeepRetro: Retrosynthetic Pathway Discovery using Iterative LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07060)

TL;DR: DeepRetro是一个结合传统模板和LLM的迭代式逆合成框架，通过动态路径探索和修正，展示了生成新颖合成路径的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决逆合成中超越预定义模板发现新路径的挑战，充分利用LLM的推理能力进行多步规划。

Method: 结合模板引擎和LLM的生成能力，通过反馈驱动的迭代循环，进行路径探索和修正。

Result: 在基准测试和案例研究中展示了生成可行且新颖的逆合成路径的能力。

Conclusion: DeepRetro通过迭代LLM推理和人类专家反馈，有望推动复杂化学合成的技术进步。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target
compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges
in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large
language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but
effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step
planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce
DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic
framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional
template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs
in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is
attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently
proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these
suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks
before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for
further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway
exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline
through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to
identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we
develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human
chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This
approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product
compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance
state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.

### [6] [DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853)

TL;DR: DiffSpectra是一种基于扩散模型的生成框架，直接从多模态光谱数据推断2D和3D分子结构，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分子结构解析方法依赖专家解释且缺乏扩展性，现有机器学习方法受限于有限库和忽略3D几何信息。DiffSpectra旨在通过生成模型克服这些限制。

Method: DiffSpectra采用扩散模型，结合SE(3)-等变架构的扩散分子变换器和基于Transformer的光谱编码器SpecFormer，实现多模态光谱数据的条件生成。

Result: 实验表明，DiffSpectra在结构解析中表现出高准确性，通过采样实现了16.01%的top-1准确率和96.86%的top-20准确率。

Conclusion: DiffSpectra首次统一了多模态光谱推理和2D/3D生成建模，为分子结构解析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in
chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,
and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation
and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced
retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits
generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising
alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that
overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In
this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers
both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using
diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional
generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion
Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates
topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,
a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral
dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact
structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through
sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,
SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight
the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the
challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is
the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D
generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

TL;DR: eegFloss是一个开源Python包，用于检测睡眠EEG记录中的伪影，提高睡眠研究的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号易受伪影干扰，影响自动睡眠分期的准确性，需要一种可靠的方法来检测和过滤伪影。

Method: 开发了eegUsability机器学习模型，基于手动标记的EEG数据进行训练和评估，并集成到eegFloss包中。

Result: eegUsability表现出色（F1分数约0.85，Cohen's kappa为0.78），能高召回率（94%）识别可用EEG数据。

Conclusion: eegFloss通过检测伪影和提供附加功能，提升了睡眠研究的精确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing
insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles
in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the
primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,
EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)
factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are
becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly
susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper
addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package
to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect
segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained
and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15
participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid
overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens
kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in
identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.
Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection
using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and
generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental
challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and
rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their
outcomes.

TL;DR: PLAME是一个新的MSA设计模型，利用预训练蛋白质语言模型的进化嵌入，提升低同源性和孤儿蛋白质的结构预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有折叠模型依赖多序列比对（MSA），但在低同源性和孤儿蛋白质上效果有限，PLAME旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PLAME引入预训练表示增强进化信息，采用保守-多样性损失提升生成质量，并提出新的MSA筛选方法和序列质量评估指标。

Result: 在AlphaFold2和AlphaFold3基准测试中，PLAME在折叠增强和序列质量评估上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PLAME有效提升低同源性和孤儿蛋白质的预测性能，可作为适配器实现AlphaFold2级精度与ESMFold推理速度。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and
understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold
have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency
limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where
MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we
propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings
from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME
introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and
employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality.
Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen
high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence
quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate
MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins,
PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence
quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while
extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the
relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving
AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.
