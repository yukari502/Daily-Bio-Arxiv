Recent deep\nlearning models like Geneformer and Mouse-Geneformer perform well on tasks such\nas cell-type classification and in silico perturbation. However, their\nspecies-specific design limits cross-species generalization and translational\napplications, which are crucial for advancing translational research and drug\ndiscovery. We present Mix-Geneformer, a novel Transformer-based model that\nintegrates human and mouse scRNA-seq data into a unified representation via a\nhybrid self-supervised approach combining Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and\nSimCSE-based contrastive loss to capture both shared and species-specific gene\npatterns. A rank-value encoding scheme further emphasizes high-variance gene\nsignals during training. Trained on about 50 million cells from diverse human\nand mouse organs, Mix-Geneformer matched or outperformed state-of-the-art\nbaselines in cell-type classification and in silico perturbation tasks,\nachieving 95.8% accuracy on mouse kidney data versus 94.9% from the best\nexisting model. It also successfully identified key regulatory genes validated\nby in vivo studies. By enabling scalable cross-species transcriptomic modeling,\nMix-Geneformer offers a powerful tool for comparative transcriptomics and\ntranslational applications. While our results demonstrate strong performance,\nwe also acknowledge limitations, such as the computational cost and variability\nin zero-shot transfer."}

However, DNA transfer between\nphylogenetically distant species, here defined as remote introgression (RI),\nhas remained poorly explored in evolutionary genomics. In this study, we\npresent RIFinder, a novel phylogeny-based method for RI event detection, and\napply it to a comprehensive dataset of 122 grass genomes. Our analysis\nidentifies 622 RI events originating from 543 distinct homologous genes,\nrevealing distinct characteristics among grass subfamilies. Specifically, the\nsubfamily Pooideae exhibits the highest number of introgressed genes while\nBambusoideae contains the lowest. Comparisons among accepted genes, their donor\ncopies and native homologs demonstrate that introgressed genes undergo\npost-transfer localized adaptation, with significant functional enrichment in\nstress-response pathways. Notably, we identify a large Triticeae-derived\nsegment in a Chloridoideae species Cleistogenes songorica, which is potentially\nassociated with its exceptional drought tolerance.

To address this, we created two original\ndatasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled\nmicrotubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely\nmimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset\npresents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence\nintensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning\nhas shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often\ndeclines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we\ndeveloped a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation\nResidual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by\nintegrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms\nin the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and\nquantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,\nnamely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,\nparticularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,\nwere largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We\nfurther benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and\nfound it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.\nFinally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained\nmicrotubules as well as to other curvilinear structures.

Here, we consider\nnon-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and\nsynthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein\nconformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control\nusing imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint\non the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the\ndriving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily\nimplementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation\nwithout consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that\nlocal stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems\nwith one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For\nhigher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in\npart due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our\nthermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly\nlarger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings\nprovide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can\nrespond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback,\nwithout highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning."}

At this scale, the\nsynchronisation processes are increasingly investigated as one of the key\nmechanisms revealing many aspects of brain functional coherence in healthy\nbrains and revealing deviations due to various brain disorders. For the human\nconnectome core network, consisting of the eight brain hubs and the\nhigher-order structure attached to them, previous simulations of Kuramoto phase\noscillators at network nodes indicate instability of the global order parameter\nfor a range of positive coupling strengths. In this work, we investigate the\nmultiscale oscillations of the global phase order parameter and show that they\nare connected with the cluster synchronisation processes occurring in this\nrange of couplings below the master stability threshold. We use the spectral\ngraph analysis and eigenvector localisation methodology, where the clusters of\nnodes playing a similar role in the synchronisation processes have a small\nmutual distance in the eigenvector space. We determine three significant\nclusters of brain regions and show the position of hubs in them. With the\nparallel analysis of the weighted core network and its binary version, we\ndemonstrate the primary role of the network's topology in the formation of\nsynchronised clusters.

To\nclose the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the\ngeneration of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,\ngenerating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,\nposes a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,\nsafety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which\nsignals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC\nsystem, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already\nestablished as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory\nepilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements\nor specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the\neffect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments\nare standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients\nwhile failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal\nhealth data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile\nand robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To\nshow the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical\nrequirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine\nlearning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only\nlimited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on\nseveral datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different\nmodulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify\nspecific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA\nmodulation."}

Departing\nfrom models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates\npathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features\ncaptured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a\ndual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain\nrepresentations.
