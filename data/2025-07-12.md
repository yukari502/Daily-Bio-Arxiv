Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Mix-Geneformer是一种基于Transformer的模型，整合人类和小鼠的单细胞RNA测序数据，通过混合自监督学习方法实现跨物种转录组建模，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物种特异性深度学习模型限制了跨物种泛化和转化应用，阻碍了转化研究和药物发现的发展。

Method: Mix-Geneformer结合Masked Language Modeling (MLM)和SimCSE对比损失的自监督方法，采用rank-value编码方案，训练于5000万人类和小鼠细胞数据。

Result: 在细胞类型分类和计算机模拟扰动任务中表现优异，小鼠肾脏数据准确率达95.8%，并成功识别关键调控基因。

Conclusion: Mix-Geneformer为比较转录组学和转化应用提供了强大工具，但存在计算成本和零样本迁移变异性等局限性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables single-cell transcriptomic
profiling, revealing cellular heterogeneity and rare populations. Recent deep
learning models like Geneformer and Mouse-Geneformer perform well on tasks such
as cell-type classification and in silico perturbation. However, their
species-specific design limits cross-species generalization and translational
applications, which are crucial for advancing translational research and drug
discovery. We present Mix-Geneformer, a novel Transformer-based model that
integrates human and mouse scRNA-seq data into a unified representation via a
hybrid self-supervised approach combining Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and
SimCSE-based contrastive loss to capture both shared and species-specific gene
patterns. A rank-value encoding scheme further emphasizes high-variance gene
signals during training. Trained on about 50 million cells from diverse human
and mouse organs, Mix-Geneformer matched or outperformed state-of-the-art
baselines in cell-type classification and in silico perturbation tasks,
achieving 95.8% accuracy on mouse kidney data versus 94.9% from the best
existing model. It also successfully identified key regulatory genes validated
by in vivo studies. By enabling scalable cross-species transcriptomic modeling,
Mix-Geneformer offers a powerful tool for comparative transcriptomics and
translational applications. While our results demonstrate strong performance,
we also acknowledge limitations, such as the computational cost and variability
in zero-shot transfer.

### [2] [Adaptive Attention Residual U-Net for curvilinear structure segmentation in fluorescence microscopy and biomedical images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07800)
*Achraf Ait Laydi,Louis Cueff,Mewen Crespo,Yousef El Mourabit,Hélène Bouvrais*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型深度学习架构ASE_Res_UNet，用于在荧光显微镜图像中分割曲线结构，尤其在噪声和低对比度条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光显微镜图像中的曲线结构分割在噪声密集或低对比度条件下具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法性能不足。

Method: 开发了ASE_Res_UNet，结合了残差块和自适应SE注意力机制，通过合成数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: ASE_Res_UNet在噪声鲁棒性和低强度结构检测上优于其他模型，并成功应用于真实图像和其他曲线结构。

Conclusion: ASE_Res_UNet在复杂条件下表现优异，具有广泛的生物医学应用潜力。

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a
challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament
networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original
datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled
microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely
mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset
presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence
intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning
has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often
declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation
Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by
integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms
in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and
quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,
namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,
particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,
were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We
further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and
found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.
Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained
microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it
successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or
low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for
applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

*Javad M Alizadeh,Mukesh K Patel,Huanmei Wu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于慢性病管理的数字孪生（DT）框架DT4PCP，并在2型糖尿病（T2D）中实现，通过实时数据收集和预测模型优化个性化护理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生技术在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但在个性化患者护理方面仍有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DT4PCP框架，整合患者实时健康数据、预测模型和社会健康决定因素（SDoH），在T2D管理中实现个性化护理。

Result: 通过回顾性模拟，证明DT4PCP-T2D能显著减少急诊风险，优化个性化护理策略。

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术有望革新慢性病护理，推动个性化医疗的发展。

Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach in
healthcare, but its application in personalized patient care remains limited.
This paper aims to present a practical implementation of DT in the management
of chronic diseases. We introduce a general DT framework for personalized care
planning (DT4PCP), with the core components being a real-time virtual
representation of a patient's health and emerging predictive models to enable
adaptive, personalized care. We implemented the DT4PCP framework for managing
Type 2 Diabetes (DT4PCP-T2D), enabling real-time collection of behavioral data
from patients with T2D, predicting emergency department (ED) risks, simulating
the effects of different interventions, and personalizing care strategies to
reduce ED visits. The DT4PCP-T2D also integrates social determinants of health
(SDoH) and other contextual data, offering a comprehensive view of the
patient's health to ensure that care recommendations are tailored to individual
needs. Through retrospective simulations, we demonstrate that integrating DTs
in T2D management can lead to significant advancements in personalized
medicine. This study underscores the potential of DT technology to
revolutionize chronic disease care.

### [4] [Local imperfect feedback control in non-equilibrium biophysical systems enabled by thermodynamic constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07295)
*Carlos Floyd,Aaron R. Dinner,Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 论文研究了非平衡生物系统如何通过局部反馈机制实现稳健控制，提出了热力学约束条件，并证明该约束使简单反馈规则能实现环境跟踪和适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生物系统如何在不完美局部信息下实现稳健控制，为自然和合成生物过程（如基因调控和蛋白质构象动力学）提供理论支持。

Method: 通过非平衡稳态模型，推导热力学约束条件，分析局部反馈机制的稳定性和适用范围。

Result: 在单或双化学调节系统中，局部稳定性隐含全局稳定性；高维系统中吸引域显著大于线性近似预期。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生物和合成系统如何通过最小反馈有效响应环境变化，无需复杂工程或精确参数调整。

Abstract: Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying
on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider
non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and
synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein
conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control
using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint
on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the
driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily
implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation
without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that
local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems
with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For
higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in
part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our
thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly
larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings
provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can
respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback,
without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了人脑连接组网络中全局相位序参数的多尺度振荡，揭示了耦合强度低于主稳定性阈值时集群同步过程的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大脑连接组网络中全局动态的同步机制，以理解健康大脑功能一致性及脑部疾病的异常表现。

Result: 确定了三个重要的大脑区域集群，展示了网络拓扑在同步集群形成中的主导作用，边权重对同步和序参数稳定性的影响。

Conclusion: 网络拓扑结构是同步集群形成的关键因素，而边权重则有助于稳定序参数并减少多重分形谱。

Abstract: Brain imaging data mapping onto human connectome networks enables the
investigation of global brain dynamics, where the brain hubs play an essential
role in transferring activity between different brain parts. At this scale, the
synchronisation processes are increasingly investigated as one of the key
mechanisms revealing many aspects of brain functional coherence in healthy
brains and revealing deviations due to various brain disorders. For the human
connectome core network, consisting of the eight brain hubs and the
higher-order structure attached to them, previous simulations of Kuramoto phase
oscillators at network nodes indicate instability of the global order parameter
for a range of positive coupling strengths. In this work, we investigate the
multiscale oscillations of the global phase order parameter and show that they
are connected with the cluster synchronisation processes occurring in this
range of couplings below the master stability threshold. We use the spectral
graph analysis and eigenvector localisation methodology, where the clusters of
nodes playing a similar role in the synchronisation processes have a small
mutual distance in the eigenvector space. We determine three significant
clusters of brain regions and show the position of hubs in them. With the
parallel analysis of the weighted core network and its binary version, we
demonstrate the primary role of the network's topology in the formation of
synchronised clusters. Meanwhile, the wights of edges contribute to the hub's
synchronisation with the surrounding cluster, stabilise the order parameter
variations and reduce the multifractal spectrum.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于系统发育的新方法RIFinder，用于检测远缘基因渗入（RI），并在122种禾草基因组中发现了622个RI事件，揭示了其在适应性进化中的重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远缘基因渗入（RI）在进化基因组学中尚未被充分研究，但其可能对物种适应性进化有重要影响。

Method: 开发了RIFinder方法，基于系统发育分析检测RI事件，并应用于122种禾草基因组数据。

Result: 发现622个RI事件，源自543个同源基因，揭示了不同禾草亚科的特征差异，并发现渗入基因在胁迫响应通路中显著富集。

Conclusion: RI在适应性进化中起关键作用，特别是在胁迫响应和生物合成基因簇的起源与多样化中。

Abstract: Genetic transfers are pervasive across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
encompassing canonical genomic introgression between species or genera and
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) across kingdoms. However, DNA transfer between
phylogenetically distant species, here defined as remote introgression (RI),
has remained poorly explored in evolutionary genomics. In this study, we
present RIFinder, a novel phylogeny-based method for RI event detection, and
apply it to a comprehensive dataset of 122 grass genomes. Our analysis
identifies 622 RI events originating from 543 distinct homologous genes,
revealing distinct characteristics among grass subfamilies. Specifically, the
subfamily Pooideae exhibits the highest number of introgressed genes while
Bambusoideae contains the lowest. Comparisons among accepted genes, their donor
copies and native homologs demonstrate that introgressed genes undergo
post-transfer localized adaptation, with significant functional enrichment in
stress-response pathways. Notably, we identify a large Triticeae-derived
segment in a Chloridoideae species Cleistogenes songorica, which is potentially
associated with its exceptional drought tolerance. Furthermore, we provide
compelling evidence that RI has contributed to the origin and diversification
of biosynthetic gene clusters of gramine, a defensive alkaloid chemical, across
grass species. Collectively, our study establishes a robust method for RI
detection and highlights its critical role in adaptive evolution.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于肠道-脑轴（GBA）间接生成信号的合成分子通信（SMC）系统，利用个人健康数据和机器学习模型设计更有效的治疗方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有治疗神经疾病（如药物难治性癫痫）的GBA调制方法效果有限且标准化不足，需利用个人健康数据改进。

Result: 模型在识别GBA调制因子方面表现出色，并成功识别了关键调制通路。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化GBA调制治疗提供了可行方案，优于现有标准化方法。

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

*Tianang Leng,Fangping Wan,Marcelo Der Torossian Torres,Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ApexOracle是一种AI模型，能预测现有化合物的抗菌效力并设计针对新病原体的分子，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗生素耐药性（AMR）加剧，现有方法无法快速识别对新病原体或耐药菌株有效的分子。

Method: 结合分子特征、基因组和文献数据的双嵌入框架，通过离散扩散语言模型整合病原体特异性信息。

Result: ApexOracle在活性预测和针对新病原体的迁移性上优于现有方法，并能设计高效新分子。

Conclusion: ApexOracle为应对AMR和未来传染病提供了可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.
