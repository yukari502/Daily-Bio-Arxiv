At this scale, the\nsynchronisation processes are increasingly investigated as one of the key\nmechanisms revealing many aspects of brain functional coherence in healthy\nbrains and revealing deviations due to various brain disorders. For the human\nconnectome core network, consisting of the eight brain hubs and the\nhigher-order structure attached to them, previous simulations of Kuramoto phase\noscillators at network nodes indicate instability of the global order parameter\nfor a range of positive coupling strengths. In this work, we investigate the\nmultiscale oscillations of the global phase order parameter and show that they\nare connected with the cluster synchronisation processes occurring in this\nrange of couplings below the master stability threshold. We use the spectral\ngraph analysis and eigenvector localisation methodology, where the clusters of\nnodes playing a similar role in the synchronisation processes have a small\nmutual distance in the eigenvector space. We determine three significant\nclusters of brain regions and show the position of hubs in them.

To\nclose the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the\ngeneration of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,\ngenerating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,\nposes a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,\nsafety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which\nsignals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC\nsystem, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already\nestablished as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory\nepilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements\nor specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the\neffect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments\nare standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients\nwhile failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal\nhealth data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile\nand robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To\nshow the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical\nrequirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine\nlearning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only\nlimited data on the GBA modulation exists.
