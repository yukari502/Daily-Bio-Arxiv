In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence\nanalysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category,\ncapturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction.\nSubstructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation,\nand their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological\nfeatures. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by\nincorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology.\nThe resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across\na variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants\nand the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative\nstudies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in\nthese tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond\nsequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the\nintegration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence\nanalysis."}

In\ncomputer science, a balanced tree is one that enables efficient updating and\nretrieval of data, whereas in biology tree balance quantifies bias in\nevolutionary processes. The lack of a precise connection between these concepts\nhas stymied the development of universal indices and general results. We\nrecently introduced a new tree balance index, $J^1$, that, unlike prior indices\npopular among biologists, permits meaningful comparison of trees with arbitrary\ndegree distributions and node sizes. Here we explain how our new index\ngeneralizes a concept that underlies the definition of the weight-balanced\ntree, an important type of self-balancing binary search tree. Our index thus\nunifies the tree balance concepts of biology and computer science. We provide\nnew analytical results to support applications of this universal index. First,\nwe quantify the accuracy of approximations to the expected values of $J^1$\nunder two important null models: the Yule process and the uniform model.\nSecond, we investigate minimal values of our index. These results help\nestablish $J^1$ as a universal, cross-disciplinary index of tree balance that\ngeneralizes and supersedes prior approaches."}

The objective\nof this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the\ngeneral principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.\n  Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and\nfunctional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures\nto Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and\nmeasures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning\ntechniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.\n  Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network\norganization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD\nand FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.\n  Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest\nthat AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across\nareas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity\n(except slow frontal activity).\n  Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain\nfunction in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity.\nDeviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits,\nwhich are specific to each of the disorders."}
