### [1] [Topological Sequence Analysis of Genomes: Category Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08043)
*Jian Liu,Li Shen,Mushal Zia,Guo-Wei Wei*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于类别拓扑的序列分析方法（CTSA），通过捕捉序列的层次结构并计算其持久同源性，提取多尺度拓扑特征，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统序列分析方法（如比对或统计表示）难以处理DNA、RNA和蛋白质序列的多尺度复杂结构，因此需要一种新的数学形式化方法。

Method: CTSA将序列建模为分辨率类别，通过范畴构造捕捉其层次结构，并计算子结构复形的持久同源性以提取拓扑特征。

Result: 实验表明，CTSA在SARS-CoV-2变种的系统发育分析和蛋白质-核酸结合亲和力预测等任务中表现优异，优于六种先进方法。

Conclusion: CTSA为生物序列分析提供了一种新框架，结合了范畴论和同调理论，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sequence data, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, exhibit intricate,
multi-scale structures that pose significant challenges for conventional
analysis methods, particularly those relying on alignment or purely statistical
representations. In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence
analysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category,
capturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction.
Substructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation,
and their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological
features. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by
incorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology.
The resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across
a variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants
and the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative
studies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in
these tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond
sequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the
integration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence
analysis.

*Kaitao Lai*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: HybridQC是一个R包，结合传统阈值过滤和机器学习异常检测，优化单细胞RNA测序数据的质量控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决scRNA-seq数据中低质量细胞的识别问题，特别是在噪声大或数据深度不足的情况下。

Method: 结合阈值过滤和机器学习（如Isolation Forest）进行异常检测，兼容Seurat对象。

Result: 提供高效、自适应的QC框架，适用于小型到中型数据集，尤其适合非模式生物或稀有样本。

Conclusion: HybridQC为scRNA-seq数据提供灵活、自动化的质量控制工具，提升下游分析的可靠性。

Abstract: HybridQC is an R package that streamlines quality control (QC) of single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by combining traditional threshold-based
filtering with machine learning-based outlier detection. It provides an
efficient and adaptive framework to identify low-quality cells in noisy or
shallow-depth datasets using techniques such as Isolation Forest, while
remaining compatible with widely adopted formats such as Seurat objects.
  The package is lightweight, easy to install, and suitable for small-to-medium
scRNA-seq datasets in research settings. HybridQC is especially useful for
projects involving non-model organisms, rare samples, or pilot studies, where
automated and flexible QC is critical for reproducibility and downstream
analysis.

Abstract: AMRScan is a hybrid bioinformatics toolkit implemented in both R and
[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) for the rapid and reproducible detection
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes from next-generation sequencing (NGS)
data. The toolkit enables users to identify AMR gene hits in sequencing reads
by aligning them against reference databases such as CARD using BLAST.
  The R implementation provides a concise, script-based approach suitable for
single-sample analysis, teaching, and rapid prototyping. In contrast, the
Nextflow implementation enables reproducible, scalable workflows for
multi-sample batch processing in high-performance computing (HPC) and
containerized environments. It leverages modular pipeline design with support
for automated database setup, quality control, conversion, BLAST alignment, and
results parsing.
  AMRScan helps bridge the gap between lightweight exploratory analysis and
production-ready surveillance pipelines, making it suitable for both research
and public health genomics applications.

### [5] [Expected and minimal values of a universal tree balance index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08615)
*Veselin Manojlović,Armaan Ahmed,Yannick Viossat,Robert Noble*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的树平衡指数$J^1$，统一了生物学和计算机科学中的树平衡概念，并提供了新的分析结果支持其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同领域（如计算机科学和生物学）对树平衡的定义独立发展，缺乏统一的概念阻碍了通用指数的发展。

Method: 引入新的树平衡指数$J^1$，能够比较任意度分布和节点大小的树，并分析其在两种重要零模型下的期望值近似准确性及最小值。

Result: $J^1$指数统一了生物学和计算机科学中的树平衡概念，并提供了新的分析结果支持其作为通用指数。

Conclusion: $J^1$是一种跨学科的通用树平衡指数，优于以往的方法。

Abstract: Although the analysis of rooted tree shape has wide-ranging applications,
notions of tree balance have developed independently in different domains. In
computer science, a balanced tree is one that enables efficient updating and
retrieval of data, whereas in biology tree balance quantifies bias in
evolutionary processes. The lack of a precise connection between these concepts
has stymied the development of universal indices and general results. We
recently introduced a new tree balance index, $J^1$, that, unlike prior indices
popular among biologists, permits meaningful comparison of trees with arbitrary
degree distributions and node sizes. Here we explain how our new index
generalizes a concept that underlies the definition of the weight-balanced
tree, an important type of self-balancing binary search tree. Our index thus
unifies the tree balance concepts of biology and computer science. We provide
new analytical results to support applications of this universal index. First,
we quantify the accuracy of approximations to the expected values of $J^1$
under two important null models: the Yule process and the uniform model.
Second, we investigate minimal values of our index. These results help
establish $J^1$ as a universal, cross-disciplinary index of tree balance that
generalizes and supersedes prior approaches.

### [6] [Distinct neurodynamics of functional brain networks in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia as revealed by EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08728)
*Sungwoo Ahn,Evie A. Malaia,Leonid L Rubchinsky*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 研究比较了阿尔茨海默病（AD）和额颞叶痴呆（FTD）的神经动力学模式，发现两者在神经活动协调性和连接性上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AD和FTD在记忆缺陷上有部分重叠，但神经动力学模式复杂且部分重叠，研究旨在揭示这些模式以理解神经动力学的一般原则。

Method: 采用多种方法研究脑节律和功能网络，包括频谱功率测量、Lyapunov指数、相位同步、时间同步模式及功能连接性测量，并结合机器学习分类技术。

Result: 多项指标显示AD和FTD在神经动力学上存在差异，AD神经活动更不协调、连接性更低且更随机，而FTD神经活动更协调（除慢额叶活动外）。

Conclusion: AD和FTD可能代表了神经活动时空协调性的相反变化，偏离正常状态导致各自特有的神经缺陷。

Abstract: Objective While Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
show some common memory deficits, these two disorders show partially
overlapping complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. The objective
of this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the
general principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.
  Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and
functional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures
to Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and
measures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning
techniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.
  Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network
organization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD
and FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.
  Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest
that AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across
areas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity
(except slow frontal activity).
  Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain
function in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity.
Deviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits,
which are specific to each of the disorders.
