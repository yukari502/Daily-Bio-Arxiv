Recent studies show that\nautoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on\nfixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard\nself-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences\ndue to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global\ntransition consistency.\n  We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian\nIntegration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised\npretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a\ntransition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions\nwith empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence,\nencouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local\ncontext. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence\nstructures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional\norganization.\n  We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory\nelement prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference,\nantimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster\nclassification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at\nleast 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior\nresults on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster),\nand shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene\nclassification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews\ncorrelation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts\naccuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory\npatterns drive prediction."}
