TL;DR: CARMANIA是一种自监督预训练框架，通过结合转移矩阵损失和上下文感知正则化，改进了核苷酸序列分析中的长程依赖性捕捉，显著提升了多项基因组任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归Transformer在核苷酸序列分析中难以有效捕捉长程依赖性，且标准自注意力机制计算效率低下。CARMANIA旨在通过整合转移矩阵损失和上下文感知正则化，解决这些问题。

Method: CARMANIA结合了下一标记预测和转移矩阵损失，后者通过对齐预测的标记转移与输入序列的n-gram统计，捕捉高阶依赖性。

Result: CARMANIA在多项基因组任务中表现优异，性能提升显著，尤其在增强子和管家基因分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CARMANIA通过整合转移矩阵损失，显著提升了核苷酸序列分析的性能，尤其在捕捉长程依赖性和全局一致性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing
long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that
autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on
fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard
self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences
due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global
transition consistency.
  We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian
Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised
pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a
transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions
with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence,
encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local
context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence
structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional
organization.
  We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory
element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference,
antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster
classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at
least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior
results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster),
and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene
classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts
accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory
patterns drive prediction.

### [3] [Generation of structure-guided pMHC-I libraries using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08902)
*Sergio Mares,Ariel Espinoza Weinberger,Nilah M. Ioannidis*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构引导的pMHC-I肽段基准测试方法，利用扩散模型设计肽段，避免了传统数据集的偏差，并揭示了序列预测模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前pMHC-I相互作用的研究受限于传统数据集（如质谱和结合实验）的偏差，影响了新肽段配体的发现。

Method: 采用扩散模型，基于晶体结构相互作用距离设计pMHC-I肽段，构建了一个独立于已知肽段的基准测试集。

Result: 该基准测试集重现了经典锚定残基偏好，且显示序列预测模型在识别结构稳定设计的结合潜力时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结构引导的设计方法提供了无偏的训练和评估资源，有助于改进个性化疫苗和T细胞免疫疗法。

Abstract: Personalized vaccines and T-cell immunotherapies depend critically on
identifying peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions capable of eliciting
potent immune responses. However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases
present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of
novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided
benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on
crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA
alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet
reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural
generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we
demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at
recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs,
indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations.
Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted
structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets,
representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation. Our
code, and data are available at: https://github.com/sermare/struct-mhc-dev.

Abstract: Cancer research is increasingly driven by the integration of diverse data
modalities, spanning from genomics and proteomics to imaging and clinical
factors. However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and
heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models
(FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data
serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new
avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing
treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted
integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational
approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends
in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological
frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer
subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome
prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional
ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs
advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with
advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available
multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration.
We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the
essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale,
pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from
conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology,
while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era
of large-scale AI models in cancer research.

### [5] [A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run'' Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136)
*Zhonglin Liu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 研究构建了动态概率布尔网络模型，结合强化学习和可解释AI，发现临时抑制LOXL2蛋白的4步策略可有效克服抗PD-1免疫治疗的先天耐药性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗PD-1免疫治疗的先天耐药性是转移性黑色素瘤的主要临床挑战，其分子机制尚不明确。

Method: 利用患者肿瘤活检的转录组数据构建动态概率布尔网络模型，结合强化学习寻找最优多步治疗干预策略，并通过可解释AI分析机制。

Result: 发现临时抑制LOXL2蛋白的4步策略可消除耐药性分子特征，使网络自我修复。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种时间依赖性治疗假说，为克服免疫治疗耐药性提供了新思路和计算框架。

Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical
challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being
poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic
Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to
elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a
reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step
therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to
mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed
that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2
protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis
showed that this ``hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the
molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct
without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel,
time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance
and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious
intervention protocols in complex biological systems.

*Qiyao Yang,Rosa Aghdam,Reed Nelson,Claudia Solís-Lemus*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 微生物网络分析工具MiNAA-WebApp通过直观的界面和可视化工具，简化了对微生物网络的研究，使其更易于广泛使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物网络分析对理解群落动态、识别关键类群及评估环境变化的影响至关重要，但现有工具对非编程背景的研究者不友好。

Method: 开发了基于网络的MiNAA-WebApp，提供直观界面和可视化功能，无需编程技能即可分析微生物网络。

Result: MiNAA-WebApp提高了微生物网络分析的易用性，适用于更广泛的用户群体，并扩展了其在计算生物学中的应用。

Conclusion: MiNAA-WebApp通过简化微生物网络分析，促进了微生物生态学和计算生物学的研究。

Abstract: Microbial networks, representing microbes as nodes and their interactions as
edges, are crucial for understanding community dynamics in various
environments. Analyzing microbiome networks is crucial for identifying keystone
taxa that play central roles in maintaining microbial community structure and
function, assessing how environmental changes such as pollution, climate
shifts, or land use affect microbial dynamics, tracking disease progression by
revealing alterations in microbial interactions over time, and predicting
microbial community responses to interventions such as antibiotics, probiotics,
or changes in diet and habitat. The complexity of microbial interactions
necessitates the use of computational tools such as the MiNAA-WebApp, available
at https://minaa.wid.wisc.edu, which enhances the accessibility of the
Microbiome Network Alignment Algorithm MiNAA. This tool allows researchers to
align microbial networks and explore ecological relationships and community
dynamics without extensive computational skills. Originally, MiNAA's
command-line interface limited its usability for those without programming
backgrounds. The web-based MiNAA-WebApp addresses this shortcoming by offering
an intuitive interface with visualization tools, allowing easy exploration and
analysis of microbial networks. The web app is designed for microbiome networks
but also applicable to other biological networks, broadening its use in
computational biology and making network-based research accessible to a wider
audience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零一生化反应网络在信号转导和细胞决策分析中至关重要，研究其退化性有助于理解生化系统中的异常动力学现象。

Method: 通过高效算法识别了所有具有三个物种的二维退化零一反应网络，并分析了其结构。

Result: 发现具有三个物种的二维退化零一反应网络，其稳态系统等价于二项式系统。

Conclusion: 二维零一反应网络的退化性与稳态系统的二项式性质相关。

Abstract: Zero-one biochemical reaction networks are widely recognized for their
importance in analyzing signal transduction and cellular decision-making
processes. Degenerate networks reveal non-standard behaviors and mark the
boundary where classical methods fail. Their analysis is key to understanding
exceptional dynamical phenomena in biochemical systems. Therefore, we focus on
investigating the degeneracy of zero-one reaction networks. It is known that
one-dimensional zero-one networks cannot degenerate. In this work, we identify
all degenerate two-dimensional zero-one reaction networks with up to three
species by an efficient algorithm. By analyzing the structure of these
networks, we arrive at the following conclusion: if a two-dimensional zero-one
reaction network with three species is degenerate, then its steady-state system
is equivalent to a binomial system.

### [8] [Towards Interpretable Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction: A Graph-Based Approach with Molecular and Network-Level Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09173)
*Mengjie Chen,Ming Zhang,Cunquan Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolecBioNet是一个新颖的图框架，整合分子和生物医学知识，用于预测药物相互作用（DDI），通过多尺度表示和特定领域的池化策略提高预测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图方法独立处理药物对，忽略了其复杂性和上下文依赖性，且难以整合生物网络和分子结构。

Method: MolecBioNet将药物对建模为统一实体，提取生物知识图的子图和分子表示的分层图，使用图神经网络学习多尺度表示，并引入CASPool和AGIPool两种池化策略。

Result: 实验表明MolecBioNet在DDI预测中优于现有方法，消融研究和嵌入可视化验证了其优势。

Conclusion: MolecBioNet通过统一建模和多尺度知识整合，提供了更准确和可解释的DDI预测。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology,
often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for
patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved
strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,
overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.
Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction
networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic
insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework
that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable
DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet
captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular
influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework
extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs
hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging
classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of
drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces
two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling
(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and
attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential
molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information
minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and
embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair
modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

TL;DR: La-Proteina是一种基于部分潜在蛋白质表示的全原子蛋白质设计模型，通过固定维度的残基潜在变量捕获序列和原子细节，解决了侧链长度变化的挑战，并在多个生成基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成模型难以直接生成全原子结构和氨基酸序列的联合分布的问题。

Method: 采用部分潜在蛋白质表示，明确建模粗粒度主干结构，通过固定维度的残基潜在变量捕获序列和原子细节，并使用流匹配建模联合分布。

Result: 在多个生成基准测试中达到最先进性能，包括全原子共设计性、多样性和结构有效性，并能生成长达800个残基的蛋白质。

Conclusion: La-Proteina在全原子蛋白质设计中表现出色，解决了现有模型的局限性，并展示了其可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have
emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully
atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is
challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that
change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic
protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse
backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details
are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby
effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations.
Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution
over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom
co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through
detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also
surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking
critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,
La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a
regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples,
demonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.

Result: 首次在生成任务中分析学习到的等变性，评估了不同因素对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 非等变CNN通过旋转增强可以学习等变性，性能接近等变模型，且更简单易用。

Abstract: Deep generative models are increasingly used for molecular discovery, with
most recent approaches relying on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs)
under the assumption that explicit equivariance is essential for generating
high-quality 3D molecules. However, these models are complex, difficult to
train, and scale poorly.
  We investigate whether non-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
trained with rotation augmentations can learn equivariance and match the
performance of equivariant models. We derive a loss decomposition that
separates prediction error from equivariance error, and evaluate how model
size, dataset size, and training duration affect performance across denoising,
molecule generation, and property prediction. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to analyze learned equivariance in generative tasks.

Result: 验证了NNP在估算活化能、预测立体选择性和复现天然产物合成关键步骤中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该策略能高效探索复杂反应机制，为天然产物合成提供新工具。

Abstract: Reaction mechanism search tools have demonstrated the ability to provide
insights into likely products and rate-limiting steps of reacting systems.
However, reactions involving several concerted bond changes - as can be found
in many key steps of natural product synthesis - can complicate the search
process. To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search
strategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary
family of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective
strategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining
graph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for
intermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network
potential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate
reaction pathway. In this article, we evaluate the NNP's ability to estimate
activation energies, demonstrate the correct anticipation of stereoselectivity,
and recapitulate complex enabling steps in natural product synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型将CRN简化为二分图或派生图，可能掩盖其物理特性，需要一种能直接研究化学相关特征的模型。

Method: 引入了一种随机生成CRN的模型，保留其超图结构和原子组成，区分两种连通性概念。

Result: 分析了两种连通性的相变行为，分别适用于开放和封闭CRN的不同场景。

Conclusion: 超图建模对揭示CRN复杂行为至关重要。

Abstract: Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex
networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as
hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite
graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler
derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical
properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the
CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that
preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling
the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach
distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but
differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like
phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity
has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the
effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is
suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of
species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of
hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个季节性霍乱模型，结合了不完全疫苗接种作为控制策略，分析了疫苗接种率和免疫力衰减率对疾病传播的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过数学模型评估疫苗接种和季节性因素对霍乱传播的影响，为公共卫生干预提供依据。

Method: 构建了一个包含易感、接种、感染、康复人群和环境病原体浓度的季节性霍乱模型，重点关注瞬时再生数作为阈值指标。

Result: 增加疫苗接种率和降低免疫力衰减率可显著降低再生数，季节性因素增加了传播复杂性。

Conclusion: 综合疫苗接种、改善卫生条件和针对性教育是减少霍乱传播和实现长期控制的关键。

Abstract: This study presents a seasonally forced cholera model that incorporates
imperfect vaccination as a control strategy. The model captures the temporal
dynamics of susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered individuals, as
well as the environmental pathogen concentration. A key focus is the
instantaneous reproduction number, which serves as a threshold indicator for
outbreak persistence or elimination. When reproduction number, the disease-free
equilibrium is attainable; otherwise, endemic conditions persist. We conduct a
sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of two critical parameters: the
vaccination rate and the waning rate of immunity. Results show that increasing
the vaccination rate and reducing the waning rate significantly decrease
reproduction number, reinforcing the importance of sustained vaccine efficacy.
Seasonal forcing amplifies the complexity of cholera dynamics, revealing the
need for timely public health interventions, especially before
high-transmission periods. This model demonstrates practical applicability in
informing vaccination strategies, especially in resource-limited settings prone
to seasonal outbreaks. It offers a flexible framework for public health
planning, adaptable to other waterborne diseases. The findings suggest that
integrated approaches combining vaccination, improved sanitation, and targeted
education are essential to reducing cholera transmission and achieving
long-term control.

Motivation: 通过多壳层扩散MRI数据的微观结构信息，结合深度学习，提高阿尔茨海默病和淀粉样蛋白积累的早期诊断准确性。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer模型处理多壳层dMRI数据，结合DTI和NODDI指标，通过低秩适应优化模型，用于疾病分类和淀粉样蛋白检测。

Result: 在疾病分类中达到95.2%的平衡准确率，淀粉样蛋白检测中最高77.2%的准确率，并识别出关键脑区如海马旁回和海马。

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: Gas transport across cell membrane is a very important process in
biochemistry which is essential for many crucial tasks, including cell
respiration pH regulation in the cell. In the late 1990's, the suggestion that
gasses are transported via preferred gas channels embedded into the cell
membrane challenged the century old Overton's theory that gases pass through
the lipid cell membrane by diffusing across the concentration gradient. Since
experimental evidence alone does not provide enough evidence to favor one of
the proposed mechanisms, mathematical models have been introduced to provide a
context for the interpretation of laboratory measurement. Following up on
previous work where the membrane permeability was estimated using particle
filter, in this article we propose an algorithm based on dictionary learning
for estimating cell membrane permeability. Computed examples illustrate that
the novel approach, which can be applied when the properties of the membrane do
not change in the course of the data collection process, is computationally
much more efficient than particle filter.

Motivation: 探索不同意象能力（从无到生动）如何影响Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具分析4000多名参与者的幻觉描述文本。

Result: 强意象者描述复杂自然内容，弱意象者报告简单几何模式；视觉语言模型能更好捕捉差异。

Conclusion: 结果反映早期视觉区与高阶区协调的个体差异，与意象谱相关。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.
