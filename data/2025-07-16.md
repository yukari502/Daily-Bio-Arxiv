Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo
mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an
advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to
investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber
tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract
differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this
study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely
AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation
testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.
There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel
atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,
along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a
novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable
simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for
multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets
with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry
with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract
Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the
proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in
detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,
AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which
are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these
demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially
localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and
related code are available at:

TL;DR: 研究通过建立HIV传播模型，分析治疗覆盖与依从性支持的平衡，提出动态控制框架以实现UNAIDS目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HIV公共卫生政策中治疗扩展与依从性支持的两难问题，优化资源分配。

Method: 建立包含药物敏感和耐药株的HIV传播模型，进行敏感性分析和最优控制理论评估。

Result: 发现长期控制HIV需优先关注依从性干预，同时扩展一线治疗覆盖。

Conclusion: 动态控制框架和依从性干预是实现HIV长期控制的关键。

Abstract: A central challenge in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) public health
policy lies in determining whether to universally expand treatment access,
despite the risk of sub-optimal adherence and consequent drug resistance, or to
adopt a more strategic allocation of resources that balances treatment coverage
with adherence support. This dilemma is further complicated by the need for
timely switching to second-line therapy, which is critical for managing
treatment failure but imposes additional burdens on limited healthcare
resources. In this study, we develop and analyze a compartmental model of HIV
transmission that incorporates both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains,
diagnosis status, and treatment progression, including switching to second-line
therapy upon detection of resistance. Basic reproduction numbers for both
strains are derived, and equilibrium analysis reveals the existence of a
disease-free state and two endemic states, where the drug-sensitive strain may
be eliminated while the drug-resistant strain persists. Local and global
sensitivity analyses are performed, using partial rank correlation coefficient
(PRCC) and Sobol methods, to identify key parameters influencing different
model outcomes. We extend the model using optimal control theory to assess
multiple intervention strategies targeting diagnosis, treatment initiation, and
adherence. A novel dynamic control framework is proposed to achieve the UNAIDS
95-95-95 targets through efficient resource allocation. Numerical simulations
validate the analytical results and compare the effectiveness and
cost-efficiency of control strategies. Our findings highlight that long-term
HIV epidemic control depends critically on prioritizing adherence-focused
interventions alongside efforts to expand first-line treatment coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高原病的分子机制尚不清楚，需通过大规模文本挖掘和网络分析揭示潜在机制和生物标志物。

Method: 结合监督机器学习和多尺度拉普拉斯图核，分析7,847篇PubMed摘要，构建生物分子事件网络。

Result: 提取150多个生物分子事件，识别EPO、VEGF等关键蛋白，发现缺氧反应、炎症和应激适应功能簇。

Conclusion: 大规模文本挖掘和图分析可揭示高原病机制并优先考虑潜在生物标志物。

Abstract: High-altitude diseases (HAD), encompassing acute mountain sickness (AMS),
high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE),
are triggered by hypobaric hypoxia at elevations above 2,500 meters. These
conditions pose significant health risks, yet the molecular mechanisms remain
insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a biomolecular event
extraction pipeline integrating supervised machine learning with feature-based
and multiscale Laplacian graph kernels to analyze 7,847 curated HAD-related
abstracts from PubMed. We extracted over 150 unique biomolecular events
including gene expression, regulation, binding, and localization and
constructed a weighted, undirected biomolecular event network comprising 97
nodes and 153 edges. Using the PageRank algorithm, we prioritized key
biomolecules based on their centrality within the event network. The top-ranked
proteins included Erythropoietin (EPO) (0.0163), Vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) (0.0148), Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha (0.0136),
Endothelial PAS Domain Protein 1 (EPAS1) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme
(ACE) (0.0119), Egl nine homolog 1 (EGLN1), Endothelin 1 (ET-1), and 70
kilodalton heat shock protein (Hsp70)(0.0118), all of which play crucial roles
in oxygen sensing, vascular remodeling, erythropoiesis, and blood pressure
regulation. Subnetwork analysis revealed three major functional clusters
centered on hypoxia response, inflammation, and stress adaptation pathways. Our
integrative approach demonstrates the utility of large-scale text mining and
graph-based analysis to uncover mechanistic insights and prioritize potential
biomarkers for high-altitude disease.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing
the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or
vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence
antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent
years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on
antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination
prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the
complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a
sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a
rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov
chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic
framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We
demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to
as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking
the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To
illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from
individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work
is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics
that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural
immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level,
and inform booster timing recommendations.

### [5] [A Simple Approximate Bayesian Inference Neural Surrogate for Stochastic Petri Net Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10714)
*Bright Kwaku Manu,Trevor Reckell,Beckett Sterner,Petar Jevtic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的替代方法，用于解决随机Petri网（SPN）中参数估计的挑战，特别是在存在外部协变量和部分观测数据的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机Petri网在建模离散事件动态时参数估计困难，尤其是在协变量依赖和缺乏显式似然函数的情况下。

Method: 使用1D卷积残差网络作为神经替代模型，通过Gillespie模拟的SPN数据进行端到端训练，学习在事件丢失的情况下反转系统动态。

Result: 在20%事件丢失的合成SPN数据上，该方法恢复率函数系数的RMSE为0.108，且比传统贝叶斯方法更快。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的无似然替代方法能够在复杂、部分观测的离散事件系统中实现准确、鲁棒和实时的参数恢复。

Abstract: Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are an increasingly popular tool of choice for
modeling discrete-event dynamics in areas such as epidemiology and systems
biology, yet their parameter estimation remains challenging in general and in
particular when transition rates depend on external covariates and explicit
likelihoods are unavailable. We introduce a neural-surrogate
(neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework
that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions
directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a
lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on
Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under
realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout
provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On
synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function
coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than
traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven,
likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter
recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.
