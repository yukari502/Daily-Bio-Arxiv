Tractometry is an\nadvanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to\ninvestigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber\ntracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract\ndifferences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this\nstudy, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely\nAGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation\ntesting to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.\nThere are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel\natlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,\nalong-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a\nnovel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable\nsimultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for\nmultiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets\nwith known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry\nwith two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract\nQuantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the\nproposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in\ndetecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,\nAGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which\nare anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these\ndemonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially\nlocalized WM group-level differences.

In this study, we develop and analyze a compartmental model of HIV\ntransmission that incorporates both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains,\ndiagnosis status, and treatment progression, including switching to second-line\ntherapy upon detection of resistance. Basic reproduction numbers for both\nstrains are derived, and equilibrium analysis reveals the existence of a\ndisease-free state and two endemic states, where the drug-sensitive strain may\nbe eliminated while the drug-resistant strain persists.
