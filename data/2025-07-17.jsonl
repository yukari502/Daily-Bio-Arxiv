Previous research uncovered such phenomena in the behavior of\nhoneybees, most notably the long-range correlations in space and time.\nFurthermore, it was demonstrated that the bee activity in the hive manifests\nthe hallmarks of the jamming process. We follow up by presenting a discrete\nmodel of the system that faithfully replicates some of the key features found\nin the data - such as the divergence of correlation length and scale-free\ndistribution of jammed clusters. The dependence of the correlation length on\nthe control parameter - density is demonstrated for both the real data and the\nmodel. We conclude with a brief discussion on the contribution of the insights\nprovided by the model to our understanding of the insects' collective behavior."}

However, these methods consider cells as\nindependent data points of population distributions. With spatial\ntranscriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic\ncell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key\ncomputational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such\ncomplex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM)\nprovides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules\nderived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address\nthis, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED)\nintegrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and\nits effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE\nnetworks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents\ngenes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning\ntheir strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match\ncontinuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from\nspatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and\nintracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate\nrepresentation of cellular dynamics."}

While machine\nlearning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks\n(GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have\ndifficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets\nand their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel\nframework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and\ninductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target\ninteraction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a\nGNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and\ntarget molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph,\nenabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate\nthe proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug\nSMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in\nits own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics,\nhighlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and\ninteraction data."}

An example is single-cell RNA\nsequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent\nspace interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear\nshifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear\ninterpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the\ndata manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data\nrepresentations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that\nregularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders\ntowards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell\ncount data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate\ngeodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances\ncompatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry.\nExperiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our\napproach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data\ndemonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation."}

In this work, we address\nthe challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making\nseveral key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step\nODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion\nmodule part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a\nsubset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions\nto the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural\npruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is\ntrained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing\ntime. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and\noptimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This\nstreamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a\ntwo-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating\nredundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process,\nProtenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop.\nEvaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity\npredictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on\nbenchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes\nProtenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources\nare limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial."}

Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient\nway for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their\ngenes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the\nworkload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic\nprediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the\nmodels to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,\nwhich remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we\nproposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice\nbreeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally\nensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual\nprojection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual\nanalysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene\nvisualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory\ngenes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the\nquantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified\nregulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback\nfrom breeders."}

However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex\ndependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we\nevaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the\npropensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific\nmetrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second\nvirial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure\ndensity. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics\nsimulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this\ndata to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive\nperformance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective\nstrengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a\nbroadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and\naccuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across\nboth phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this\nmetric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties\nfor IDP systems.
