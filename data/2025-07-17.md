Abstract: The collective behavior of numerous animal species, including insects,
exhibits scale-free behavior indicative of the critical (second-order) phase
transition. Previous research uncovered such phenomena in the behavior of
honeybees, most notably the long-range correlations in space and time.
Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the bee activity in the hive manifests
the hallmarks of the jamming process. We follow up by presenting a discrete
model of the system that faithfully replicates some of the key features found
in the data - such as the divergence of correlation length and scale-free
distribution of jammed clusters. The dependence of the correlation length on
the control parameter - density is demonstrated for both the real data and the
model. We conclude with a brief discussion on the contribution of the insights
provided by the model to our understanding of the insects' collective behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域缺乏解释基础模型推理的工具，稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在视觉领域已有应用，但尚未在医学影像中广泛使用。

Method: 提出CytoSAE模型，基于40,000多张外周血单细胞图像训练，适用于多样化和域外数据集。

Result: CytoSAE能识别形态学相关概念，并在AML亚型分类任务中表现优异，同时提供亚细胞级别的可解释性。

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学影像提供了一种可解释的工具，适用于疾病检测和分类任务。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

### [3] [STAGED: A Multi-Agent Neural Network for Learning Cellular Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11660)
*Joao F. Rocha,Ke Xu,Xingzhi Sun,Ananya Krishna,Dhananjay Bhaskar,Blanche Mongeon,Morgan Craig,Mark Gerstein,Smita Krishnaswamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合深度学习和基于代理的建模（ABM）的方法STAGED，用于模拟细胞间通讯及其对细胞内基因调控网络的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞技术虽能揭示细胞状态和亚群，但传统方法将细胞视为独立数据点，忽略了细胞间动态相互作用。空间转录组学提供了细胞组织信息，但需要新的计算方法来学习复杂的细胞动态。

Method: STAGED方法结合ABM与深度学习，使用图ODE网络（GDEs）动态学习基因间相互作用强度，并通过注意力机制优化。

Result: 模型能够匹配模拟和空间转录组数据推断的连续轨迹，捕捉细胞间和细胞内相互作用，更准确地表示细胞动态。

Conclusion: STAGED为细胞动态建模提供了更自适应和准确的方法，有望推动对复杂细胞系统的理解。

Abstract: The advent of single-cell technology has significantly improved our
understanding of cellular states and subpopulations in various tissues under
normal and diseased conditions by employing data-driven approaches such as
clustering and trajectory inference. However, these methods consider cells as
independent data points of population distributions. With spatial
transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic
cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key
computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such
complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM)
provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules
derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address
this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED)
integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and
its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE
networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents
genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning
their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match
continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from
spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and
intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate
representation of cellular dynamics.

Method: 引入GiG框架，将药物和靶标分子结构图表示为药物-靶标相互作用图中的元节点，结合转导学习和归纳学习。

Result: GiG模型在所有评估指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合不同学习范式和相互作用数据能显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for
advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine
learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have
difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets
and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel
framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and
inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target
interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a
GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and
target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph,
enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate
the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug
SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in
its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model
significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics,
highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and
interaction data.

### [5] [Enforcing Latent Euclidean Geometry in Single-Cell VAEs for Manifold Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11789)

Method: FlatVI通过正则化潜在流形，使其更接近欧几里得几何，从而优化单细胞计数数据的建模。

Result: 实验表明，FlatVI在合成数据上理论合理，在时间分辨的单细胞RNA测序数据中改进了轨迹重建和流形插值。

Conclusion: FlatVI通过优化潜在流形的几何性质，提高了单细胞RNA测序数据的建模效果。

Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep
generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA
sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent
space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear
shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear
interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the
data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data
representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that
regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders
towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell
count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate
geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances
compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry.
Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our
approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data
demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

### [6] [Protenix-Mini: Efficient Structure Predictor via Compact Architecture, Few-Step Diffusion and Switchable pLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11839)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Protenix-Mini，一种轻量化的蛋白质结构预测模型，通过优化采样策略和架构设计，显著降低计算开销，同时保持较高的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物分子结构预测中模型效率与预测精度平衡的挑战，以适应实际应用中的高效部署和大规模推理需求。

Method: 1) 用少步ODE采样器替代多步AF3采样器；2) 对Protenix框架中的冗余Transformer模块进行剪枝和轻量化设计；3) 用ESM模块替代传统MSA模块，减少预处理时间。

Result: Protenix-Mini在基准数据集上表现优异，性能仅下降1-5%，同时显著降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: Protenix-Mini是计算资源有限但需要高精度结构预测应用的理想选择。

Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and
other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and
inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address
the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making
several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step
ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion
module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a
subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions
to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural
pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is
trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing
time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and
optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This
streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a
two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process,
Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop.
Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity
predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes
Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources
are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the
resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits,
such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient
way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their
genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the
workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic
prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the
models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,
which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we
proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice
breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally
ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual
projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual
analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene
visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory
genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the
quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified
regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback
from breeders.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological
processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex
dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we
evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the
propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific
metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second
virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure
density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this
data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive
performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective
strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a
broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and
accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across
both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this
metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties
for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond
binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior
or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.
