Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient\nway for hybrid rice breeding.

However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic\nprediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the\nmodels to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,\nwhich remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we\nproposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice\nbreeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally\nensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual\nprojection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual\nanalysis.
