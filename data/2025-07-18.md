Conclusion: GLOMIA-Pro 具有鲁棒性和通用性，适用于多种临床场景。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical images are essential for monitoring disease progression
by capturing spatiotemporal changes associated with dynamic biological
processes. While current methods have made progress in modeling spatiotemporal
patterns, they face three key limitations: (1) lack of generalizable framework
applicable to diverse disease progression prediction tasks; (2) frequent
overlook of the ordinal nature inherent in disease staging; (3) susceptibility
to representation collapse due to structural similarities between adjacent time
points, which can obscure subtle but discriminative progression biomarkers. To
address these limitations, we propose a Generalizable LOngitudinal Medical
Image Analysis framework for disease Progression prediction (GLOMIA-Pro).
GLOMIA-Pro consists of two core components: progression representation
extraction and progression-aware fusion. The progression representation
extraction module introduces a piecewise orthogonal attention mechanism and
employs a novel ordinal progression constraint to disentangle finegrained
temporal imaging variations relevant to disease progression. The
progression-aware fusion module incorporates a redesigned skip connection
architecture which integrates the learned progression representation with
current imaging representation, effectively mitigating representation collapse
during cross-temporal fusion. Validated on two distinct clinical applications:
knee osteoarthritis severity prediction and esophageal cancer treatment
response assessment, GLOMIA-Pro consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art
longitudinal analysis methods. Ablation studies further confirm the
contribution of individual components, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of GLOMIA-Pro across diverse clinical scenarios.

### [2] [Continued domain-specific pre-training of protein language models for pMHC-I binding prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13077)
*Sergio E. Mares,Ariel Espinoza Weinberger,Nilah M. Ioannidis*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过领域特定的预训练提升蛋白质语言模型在预测pMHC-I结合亲和力中的表现，解决了数据稀缺和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于HLA等位基因多样性高（约30,000种）、大多数等位基因数据稀缺以及实验测量噪声大，预测pMHC-I结合亲和力仍具挑战性。现有方法在代表性不足的等位基因和定量预测方面表现不佳。

Method: 从ESM Cambrian（3亿参数）出发，通过掩码语言建模（MLM）对HLA相关肽（表位）进行持续预训练，测试了两种输入格式：单独表位序列与表位与HLA重链序列的拼接。随后仅使用高质量定量数据微调IC50结合亲和力预测，避免现有方法中质谱偏差的继承。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 领域特定的持续预训练可能有助于提升pMHC-I结合亲和力预测模型的性能，尤其是在数据稀缺和噪声问题突出的情况下。

Abstract: Predicting peptide--major histocompatibility complex I (pMHC-I) binding
affinity remains challenging due to extreme allelic diversity ($\sim$30,000 HLA
alleles), severe data scarcity for most alleles, and noisy experimental
measurements. Current methods particularly struggle with underrepresented
alleles and quantitative binding prediction. We test whether domain-specific
continued pre-training of protein language models is beneficial for their
application to pMHC-I binding affinity prediction. Starting from ESM Cambrian
(300M parameters), we perform masked-language modeling (MLM)-based continued
pre-training on HLA-associated peptides (epitopes), testing two input formats:
epitope sequences alone versus epitopes concatenated with HLA heavy chain
sequences. We then fine-tune for functional IC$_{50}$ binding affinity
prediction using only high-quality quantitative data, avoiding mass
spectrometry biases that are inherited by existing methods.

### [3] [Assay2Mol: large language model-based drug design using BioAssay context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12574)
*Yifan Deng,Spencer S. Ericksen,Anthony Gitter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Assay2Mol利用大型语言模型从非结构化生化筛选数据中生成候选药物分子，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生化筛选数据中的非结构化文本包含丰富信息，但未被充分利用。Assay2Mol旨在利用这些数据加速早期药物发现。

Method: Assay2Mol通过检索类似目标的现有筛选记录，并利用上下文学习生成候选分子。

Result: Assay2Mol在生成候选配体分子方面优于现有机器学习方法，且分子更易合成。

Conclusion: Assay2Mol为早期药物发现提供了一种高效的新方法。

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

### [4] [Disentangling coincident cell events using deep transfer learning and compressive sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13176)
*Moritz Leuthner,Rafael Vorländer,Oliver Hayden*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合全卷积神经网络（FCN）和压缩感知（CS）的混合框架，用于解决单细胞分析中信号重叠问题，显著提高了事件恢复率和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞分析的准确性对诊断和细胞治疗至关重要，但信号重叠会严重影响数据质量。

Method: 使用FCN估计重叠事件数量，并结合CS模块重建单个信号成分。

Result: 比传统算法恢复多21%的事件，分类准确率超过97%。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代非光学单细胞传感平台奠定了基础，扩展了细胞术在医学中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate single-cell analysis is critical for diagnostics, immunomonitoring,
and cell therapy, but coincident events - where multiple cells overlap in a
sensing zone - can severely compromise signal fidelity. We present a hybrid
framework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive
sensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor
data. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates
coincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and
CD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module
reconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise
recovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and
hydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine
algorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and
improving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class
activation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures
transparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow
cytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating
modalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse
sensing. This work lays the foundation for next-generation non-optical
single-cell sensing platforms that are automated, generalizable, and capable of
resolving overlapping events, broadening the utility of cytometry in
translational medicine and precision diagnostics, e.g. cell-interaction
studies.

*Hamidreza Akef,Minki Hhan,David Soloveichik*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种迭代算法来计算分子复合物的平衡浓度，特别关注聚合物-单体系统中的无热设置，旨在实现目标聚合物的高浓度和非目标聚合物的低浓度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算分子复合物的平衡浓度在分析上通常难以处理，需要数值方法。现有方法在处理DNA纳米技术中强结合域基础的体系时缺乏有效的设计和验证框架，特别是当配置由熵力区分时。

Method: 开发了一种迭代算法来分配聚合物浓度以满足详细平衡条件。该方法专注于无热设置（所有相互作用保持焓），不使用每个聚合物的自由能参数，而是基于最大整体结合的原理。算法将离散配置的组合论证与实值浓度连接起来。

Result: 算法能够有效地使目标聚合物达到高浓度，非目标聚合物保持低浓度。该方法提供了对非目标聚合物浓度上界的有效洞察，并成功应用于减少DNA逻辑和信号传播中的泄漏问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为熵力区分配置时的平衡浓度设计和验证提供了新的框架。该方法在DNA纳米技术的强结合域基础体系中具有实际应用价值，为分子复合物平衡浓度的计算提供了新的数值方法。

Abstract: Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally
analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we
focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers)
combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy
parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all
interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded
(domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different
ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the
saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model.
Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer
concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers
are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even
if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper
bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial
arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to
real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to
decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new
framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when
configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用NLP模型（如BioClinicalBERT）自动分类药物过量死亡报告，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国药物过量死亡数据因依赖ICD-10编码而延迟和信息丢失，NLP模型可解决这一问题。

Method: 使用35,433份2020年死亡记录训练模型，并在3,335份2023-2024年记录上验证，比较了多种NLP方法。

Result: BioClinicalBERT在内部测试集上F1分数>=0.998，外部验证F1=0.966，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: NLP模型（尤其是BioClinicalBERT）能高效准确分类药物过量死亡，支持实时监测。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.
