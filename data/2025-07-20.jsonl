In this work we\nfocus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers)\ncombine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy\nparameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all\ninteractions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded\n(domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different\nways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the\nsaturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model.\nWithin this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer\nconcentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers\nare in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even\nif not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper\nbounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial\narguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to\nreal-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to\ndecreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new\nframework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when\nconfigurations are distinguished by entropic forces."}

While current methods have made progress in modeling spatiotemporal\npatterns, they face three key limitations: (1) lack of generalizable framework\napplicable to diverse disease progression prediction tasks; (2) frequent\noverlook of the ordinal nature inherent in disease staging; (3) susceptibility\nto representation collapse due to structural similarities between adjacent time\npoints, which can obscure subtle but discriminative progression biomarkers. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a Generalizable LOngitudinal Medical\nImage Analysis framework for disease Progression prediction (GLOMIA-Pro).\nGLOMIA-Pro consists of two core components: progression representation\nextraction and progression-aware fusion. The progression representation\nextraction module introduces a piecewise orthogonal attention mechanism and\nemploys a novel ordinal progression constraint to disentangle finegrained\ntemporal imaging variations relevant to disease progression. The\nprogression-aware fusion module incorporates a redesigned skip connection\narchitecture which integrates the learned progression representation with\ncurrent imaging representation, effectively mitigating representation collapse\nduring cross-temporal fusion. Validated on two distinct clinical applications:\nknee osteoarthritis severity prediction and esophageal cancer treatment\nresponse assessment, GLOMIA-Pro consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art\nlongitudinal analysis methods. Ablation studies further confirm the\ncontribution of individual components, demonstrating the robustness and\ngeneralizability of GLOMIA-Pro across diverse clinical scenarios."}

However, critical\noverdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays\nand information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of\nDisease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may\nautomate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been\nlimited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in\n2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was\nconducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.\nMultiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug\ninvolvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included\ntraditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned\nencoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large\nlanguage models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed\nusing macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to\nquantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect\nperformance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External\nvalidation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional\nmachine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large\nlanguage models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like\nBioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose\ndeath classification from free-text reports.

We present a hybrid\nframework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive\nsensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor\ndata. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates\ncoincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and\nCD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module\nreconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise\nrecovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and\nhydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine\nalgorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and\nimproving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class\nactivation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures\ntransparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow\ncytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating\nmodalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse\nsensing. This work lays the foundation for next-generation non-optical\nsingle-cell sensing platforms that are automated, generalizable, and capable of\nresolving overlapping events, broadening the utility of cytometry in\ntranslational medicine and precision diagnostics, e.g. cell-interaction\nstudies."}
