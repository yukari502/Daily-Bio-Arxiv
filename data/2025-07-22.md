Abstract: Membrane protein classification is a fundamental task in structural
bioinformatics, critical to understanding protein functions and accelerating
drug discovery. In this study, we propose MP-GCAN, a novel graph-based
classification model that leverages both spatial and sequential features of
proteins. MP-GCAN combines GCN, GAT, and GIN layers to capture hierarchical
structural representations from 3D protein graphs, constructed from
high-resolution PDB files with $\alpha$-carbon coordinates and residue types.
To evaluate performance, we curated a high-quality dataset of 500 membrane and
500 non-membrane proteins, and compared MP-GCAN with two baselines: a
structure-confidence-based SGD classifier utilizing AlphaFold's pLDDT scores,
and DeepTMHMM, a sequence-based deep learning model. Our experiments
demonstrate that MP-GCAN significantly outperforms baselines, achieving an
accuracy of 96% and strong F1-scores on both classes. The results highlight the
importance of integrating pretrained GNN architectures with domain-specific
structural data to enhance membrane protein classification.

### [2] [KinForm: Kinetics Informed Feature Optimised Representation Models for Enzyme $k_{cat}$ and $K_{M}$ Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14639)
*Saleh Alwer,Ronan Fleming*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: KinForm是一个机器学习框架，通过优化蛋白质特征表示来预测酶动力学参数（如kcat和KM），在基准数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验数据在规模和多样性上有限，现有方法通常使用单一蛋白质语言模型的平均池化残基嵌入，预测精度和泛化能力不足。

Method: KinForm结合多种残基级嵌入，基于结合位点概率进行加权池化，应用PCA降维，并通过相似性过采样策略重新平衡训练数据。

Result: KinForm在低序列相似性区间表现显著提升，结合位点概率池化、中间层选择、PCA和过采样均对性能有贡献。

Conclusion: 去除折叠间的序列重叠能更真实评估泛化能力，应作为动力学预测模型基准测试的标准。

Abstract: Kinetic parameters such as the turnover number ($k_{cat}$) and Michaelis
constant ($K_{\mathrm{M}}$) are essential for modelling enzymatic activity but
experimental data remains limited in scale and diversity. Previous methods for
predicting enzyme kinetics typically use mean-pooled residue embeddings from a
single protein language model to represent the protein. We present KinForm, a
machine learning framework designed to improve predictive accuracy and
generalisation for kinetic parameters by optimising protein feature
representations. KinForm combines several residue-level embeddings
(Evolutionary Scale Modeling Cambrian, Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2, and
ProtT5-XL-UniRef50), taken from empirically selected intermediate transformer
layers and applies weighted pooling based on per-residue binding-site
probability. To counter the resulting high dimensionality, we apply
dimensionality reduction using principal--component analysis (PCA) on
concatenated protein features, and rebalance the training data via a
similarity-based oversampling strategy. KinForm outperforms baseline methods on
two benchmark datasets. Improvements are most pronounced in low sequence
similarity bins. We observe improvements from binding-site probability pooling,
intermediate-layer selection, PCA, and oversampling of low-identity proteins.
We also find that removing sequence overlap between folds provides a more
realistic evaluation of generalisation and should be the standard over random
splitting when benchmarking kinetic prediction models.

Result: 在多个蛋白质家族中，该方法实现了高精度的注释质量，并能生成功能一致的序列。

Conclusion: 结合自监督学习和轻监督学习，可以有效解决蛋白质功能预测和设计中的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Accurately annotating and controlling protein function from sequence data
remains a major challenge, particularly within homologous families where
annotated sequences are scarce and structural variation is minimal. We present
a two-stage approach for semi-supervised functional annotation and conditional
sequence generation in protein families using representation learning. First,
we demonstrate that protein language models, pretrained on large and diverse
sequence datasets and possibly finetuned via contrastive learning, provide
embeddings that robustly capture fine-grained functional specificities, even
with limited labeled data. Second, we use the inferred annotations to train a
generative probabilistic model, an annotation-aware Restricted Boltzmann
Machine, capable of producing synthetic sequences with prescribed functional
labels. Across several protein families, we show that this approach achieves
highly accurate annotation quality and supports the generation of functionally
coherent sequences. Our findings underscore the power of combining
self-supervised learning with light supervision to overcome data scarcity in
protein function prediction and design.

Abstract: Multisite protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular
signaling and decision-making processes. In this study, we focus on the
mathematical underpinnings and informational aspects of sequential,
distributive phosphorylation systems. We first provide rigorous steady-state
solutions derived using geometric series arguments and formal mathematical
induction, demonstrating that the distribution of phosphorylation states
follows a geometric progression determined by the kinase-to-phosphatase
activity ratio. We then extend the analysis with entropy-based insights,
quantifying uncertainty in phosphorylation states and examining the mutual
information between kinase activity and phosphorylation levels through a
truncated Poisson model. These results highlight how phosphorylation dynamics
introduce both structured patterns and inherent signal variability. By
combining exact mathematical proofs with entropy analysis, this work clarifies
key quantitative features of multisite phosphorylation from a systems-level
perspective.

Abstract: Constructing cell developmental trajectories is a critical task in
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, enabling the inference of
potential cellular progression paths. However, current automated methods are
limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual
samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to
construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider
cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to
the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address
this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample
cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics
system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell
developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed
the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and
developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the
spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories.
Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell
distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To
demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of
our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its
usefulness and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is
available at https://github.com/praneethnamburi/DUSTrack.
