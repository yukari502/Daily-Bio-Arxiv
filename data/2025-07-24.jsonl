Efficient\ncomputational approaches are urgently needed to support large-scale similarity\nsearch, a foundational task in bioinformatics for detecting homology,\nfunctional similarity, and novelty among genomic and proteomic sequences.\nAlthough tools like BLAST have been widely used and remain effective in many\nscenarios, they suffer from limitations such as high computational cost and\npoor performance on divergent sequences.\n  In this work, we explore embedding-based similarity search methods that learn\nlatent representations capturing deeper structural and functional patterns\nbeyond raw sequence alignment. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art\nvector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, on biologically meaningful gene\nembeddings. Unlike prior studies, our analysis focuses on\nbioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmarks their utility for detecting\nnovel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking\nknown homologs. Our results highlight both computational advantages (in memory\nand runtime efficiency) and improved retrieval quality, offering a promising\nalternative to traditional alignment-heavy tools."}

In this context, we\nintroduce Bayesian hierarchical models as an alternative methodology to\nclassical statistical techniques for analysing nominal polytomous data in\nlongitudinal studies. The theoretical foundation is based on the use of\nnon-informative priors and advanced computational techniques, such as Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which enable a robust and flexible data\nanalysis framework. As a motivating example, the procedure is illustrated\nthrough an applied study in agrarian science, focusing on animal welfare, which\nassessed seven types of behaviours exhibited by pigs over twelve weeks. The\nresults demonstrated the efficacy of Bayesian hierarchical models for the\nanalysis of longitudinal nominal polytomous data. Since the computational\nprocedures were implemented in the R software and the codes are available, this\nwork will serve as support for those who need such analyses, especially in\nagricultural designs, where longitudinal categorical data are frequently\nencountered."}

Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs),\nincluding SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury\n(NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied\nAI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary\nclassification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors.\nThis study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs),\nspecifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs\nfrom psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to\nend generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods,\nincluding label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error\nanalysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match\naccuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior\nperformance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets,\nindicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal\nsystematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight\nthe models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only\ndemonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical\nclassification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured\nEHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine."}

In essence, variational inference\nentails an optimization over a given family of probability distributions to\nchoose the member of this family best approximating the posterior. Variational\nLaplace, an iterative update scheme motivated by this objective, is widely used\nin different contexts in the cognitive neuroscience community. However, until\nnow, the theoretical properties of this scheme have not been systematically\ninvestigated. Here, we study variational Laplace in the light of frequentist\nasymptotic statistics. Asymptotical frequentist theory enables one to judge the\nquality of point estimates by their limit behaviour. We apply this framework to\nfind that point estimates generated by variational Laplace enjoy the desirable\nproperties of asymptotic consistency and efficiency in two toy examples.\nFurthermore, we derive conditions that are sufficient to establish these\nproperties in a general setting. Besides of point estimates, we also study the\nfrequentist convergence of distributions in the sense of total variation\ndistance, which may be useful to relate variational Laplace both to recent\nfindings regarding variational inference as well as to classical frequentist\nconsiderations on the Bayesian posterior. Finally, to illustrate the validity\nof our theoretical considerations, we conduct simulation experiments in our\nstudy examples."}
