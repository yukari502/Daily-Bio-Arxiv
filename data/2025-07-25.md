Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

Conclusion: 自监督学习可提升分割性能，减少对大数据集的依赖，有望改善临床诊断流程和患者预后。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

### [3] [Improving reproducibility of cheminformatics workflows with chembl-downloader](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17783)
*Charles Tapley Hoyt*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文介绍了`chembl-downloader`，一个用于从ChEMBL FTP服务器可重复获取、访问和操作数据的Python包，解决了现有数据集生成方法不透明、难以复制和过时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从ChEMBL衍生的数据集缺乏生成代码，导致方法不透明、难以复制且数据过时，影响了结果的解释和信任度。

Method: 开发了`chembl-downloader`，一个Python包，通过FTP服务器提供可重复的ChEMBL数据获取和操作。

Result: `chembl-downloader`提供了透明、可更新和可信赖的数据集生成工具，支持最新或指定版本的ChEMBL数据。

Conclusion: `chembl-downloader`解决了ChEMBL数据集生成中的透明性和可重复性问题，为研究提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Many modern cheminformatics workflows derive datasets from ChEMBL, but few of
these datasets are published with accompanying code for their generation.
Consequently, their methodologies (e.g., selection, filtering, aggregation) are
opaque, reproduction is difficult, and interpretation of results therefore
lacks important context. Further, such static datasets quickly become
out-of-date. For example, the current version of ChEMBL is v35 (as of December
2024), but ExCAPE-DB uses v20, Deep Confidence uses v23, the consensus dataset
from Isigkeit _et al._ (2022) uses v28, and Papyrus uses v30. Therefore, there
is a need for tools that provide reproducible bulk access to the latest (or a
given) version of ChEMBL in order to enable researchers to make their derived
datasets more transparent, updatable, and trustworthy. This article introduces
`chembl-downloader`, a Python package for the reproducible acquisition, access,
and manipulation of ChEMBL data through its FTP server. It can be downloaded
under the MIT license from https://github.com/cthoyt/chembl-downloader and
installed from PyPI with `pip install chembl-downloader.`

### [4] [Deep Learning for Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18557)
*Zihan Yang,Haipeng Gong*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文综述了AI在预测血脑屏障（BBB）通透性中的演变，从传统方法到现代多任务和生成模型，强调了从静态分类向机制感知的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测BBB通透性是神经药物开发的关键步骤，传统方法易产生系统误判，早期机器学习模型能力有限。AI方法因其建模能力和捕捉复杂机制的能力成为重要工具。

Method: 系统回顾了从深度神经网络到基于图的结构建模的演变，重点介绍了多任务和多模态学习策略的优势，以及生成模型和因果推理方法的应用。

Result: AI方法推动了BBB建模从静态分类向机制感知和结构功能建模的转变。

Conclusion: 这一范式转变为AI在神经药理学开发中的整合提供了方法论基础和未来路线图。

Abstract: Predicting whether a molecule can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a
key step in early-stage neuropharmaceutical development, directly influencing
both research efficiency and success rates in drug discovery. Traditional
empirical methods based on physicochemical properties are prone to systematic
misjudgements due to their reliance on static rules. Early machine learning
models, although data-driven, often suffer from limited capacity, poor
generalization, and insufficient interpretability. In recent years, artificial
intelligence (AI) methods have become essential tools for predicting BBB
permeability and guiding related drug design, owing to their ability to model
molecular structures and capture complex biological mechanisms. This article
systematically reviews the evolution of this field-from deep neural networks to
graph-based structural modeling-highlighting the advantages of multi-task and
multimodal learning strategies in identifying mechanism-relevant variables. We
further explore the emerging potential of generative models and causal
inference methods for integrating permeability prediction with mechanism-aware
drug design. BBB modeling is in the transition from static classification
toward mechanistic perception and structure-function modeling. This paradigm
shift provides a methodological foundation and future roadmap for the
integration of AI into neuropharmacological development.

### [5] [Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940)
*Timothy Wilson,Owen J. L. Rackham,Hendrik Ulbricht*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 通过光机械实验检测寡核苷酸信号，功能化硅纳米颗粒与非功能化颗粒在振荡频率和振幅上存在差异，理论模型和机器学习方法验证了这些差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究功能化硅纳米颗粒在光阱中的行为差异，以探索寡核苷酸信号的特异性检测方法。

Method: 使用1550 nm激光在真空中捕获功能化硅纳米颗粒，通过光学干涉仪检测其振荡频率和振幅，结合理论模型和机器学习分析数据。

Result: 功能化与非功能化硅纳米颗粒在振荡特性上存在显著差异，随机森林模型进一步验证了这些差异。

Conclusion: 光机械实验和机器学习方法可用于检测寡核苷酸信号，功能化硅纳米颗粒表现出独特的振荡行为。

Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in
sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were
functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and
deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm
wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic
oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely
detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle
types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with
respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model.
Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to
the spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the
functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided
further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups.
Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual
differences between the particle types

### [6] [Towards Robust Foundation Models for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17845)
*Jonah Kömen,Edwin D. de Jong,Julius Hense,Hannah Marienwald,Jonas Dippel,Philip Naumann,Eric Marcus,Lukas Ruff,Maximilian Alber,Jonas Teuwen,Frederick Klauschen,Klaus-Robert Müller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了生物医学基础模型（FMs）对非生物学技术特征的鲁棒性，提出了PathoROB基准和框架，以量化并提升FMs的鲁棒性，减少临床部署中的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学FMs在临床验证中存在对非生物学技术特征（如手术技术、实验室程序等）的敏感性，可能导致临床错误，因此需要系统评估和提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了PathoROB基准，包含三个新指标和四个数据集，评估了20种FMs的鲁棒性，并提出了鲁棒化框架。

Result: 实验显示所有FMs均存在鲁棒性不足问题，非鲁棒性可能导致重大诊断错误；使用更鲁棒的FMs和后处理鲁棒化可减少风险。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性评估是临床采用FMs前的必要步骤，未来FMs开发需将鲁棒性作为核心设计原则，PathoROB为跨生物医学领域的鲁棒性评估提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.
