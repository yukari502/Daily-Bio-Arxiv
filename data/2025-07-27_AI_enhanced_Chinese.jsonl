The lack of large, annotated datasets for model\ntraining exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools\nthat could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which\nleverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer\nlearning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while\nminimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with\nonly 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice\nscore, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This\ndemonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance\nand reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to\nhighlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary\nartery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for\nadvancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation\naccuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve\nclinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease\ndetection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

However, their\nsusceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including\nvariations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and\nscanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first\nsystematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.\nOur work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates\nthe consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM\nrobustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,\na robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness\nindex, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical\ncenters. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated\nFMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that\nnon-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and\nclinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs\nand post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)\nthe risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is\nessential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and\ndemonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core\ndesign principle.

Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were\nfunctionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and\ndeoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm\nwavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic\noscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely\ndetected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle\ntypes, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with\nrespect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model.\nData obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to\nthe spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the\nfunctionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided\nfurther evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups.\nTransmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual\ndifferences between the particle types", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u673a\u68b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5be1\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u7845\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5be1\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u7845\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u5149\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281550 nm\u6fc0\u5149\u5728\u771f\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u7845\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u632f\u8361\u9891\u7387\u548c\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u7845\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u9891\u7387\u3001\u5cf0\u5bbd\u548c\u632f\u5e45\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u673a\u68b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u7845\u7eb3\u7c73\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u4e3a\u5be1\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
