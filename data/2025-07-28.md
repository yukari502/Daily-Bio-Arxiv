*Oluwafemi Ogundare*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种基于肿瘤浸润免疫细胞相关基因（CCL8和TYR）的风险评分系统，用于结直肠癌的预后评估，并在外部队列中验证了其有效性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预后方法未能完全捕捉结直肠癌的生物学复杂性，因此需要更准确的预后评估工具。

Method: 通过RNA-seq和CIBERSORTx分析筛选预后标志物，使用高斯混合模型选择最优基因组合，并在外部队列中验证风险评分系统。

Result: 基于CCL8和TYR的风险评分系统能显著区分高低风险组，并与TNM分期结合作为独立预后因素。

Conclusion: 该风险评分系统可有效分层患者预后，结合TNM分期有助于指导治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) remains a leading cause of
cancer-related mortality worldwide, with variable patient outcomes despite
treatment advances. Traditional prognostic methods based on clinicopathological
variables alone do not fully capture the biological complexity of the disease.
This study aims to develop a risk scoring system based on genes associated with
tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC-associated genes) to improve prognostic
assessment in CRC.
  Methods: RNA-seq gene expression and clinicopathological data from TCGA-CRC
(647 tumor samples, 51 normal tissues) were analyzed to identify differentially
expressed TIIC-associated genes through comparison with the CIBERSORTx
database. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to screen for
prognostic markers. A Gaussian mixture model was applied to cluster prognostic
models and select the model with the most robust gene combination. The
resulting risk scoring system was validated in an external cohort (GSE39582)
and integrated with clinicopathological variables to develop a prognostic
nomogram.
  Results: From 128 TIIC-associated genes, an optimal prognostic model
comprising CCL8 and TYR was identified. The risk score was calculated as
0.152*Exp(CCL8) - 0.516*Exp(TYR). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significant
survival differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in both TCGA-CRC (p
< 0.05) and GSE39582 (p < 0.05). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed AUC values
ranging from 0.605 to 0.696 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in TCGA-CRC
and GSE39582. Multivariate Cox analysis identified TNM_T, TNM_N, and risk score
as independent prognostic factors.
  Conclusion: Our risk scoring system based on CCL8 and TYR effectively
stratifies CRC patients into distinct prognostic groups and could guide
treatment decisions, particularly when integrated with TNM staging in a
nomogram.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种分析斑马鱼中巨噬细胞动态行为的工作流程，揭示了M1和M2巨噬细胞在形态和运动上的差异，并量化了其行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巨噬细胞在伤口愈合中具有重要作用，但其在体内环境中的行为定量分析仍有限。

Method: 通过计算一组全面的形态动力学特征，分析M1和M2巨噬细胞的行为差异。

Result: M1巨噬细胞表现出较少的形状伸长、更定向的运动和更少的随机运动；未表达TNF的巨噬细胞距离伤口更远。

Conclusion: 研究提供了巨噬细胞在伤口愈合中的定量行为分析，揭示了不同激活状态下的行为差异。

Abstract: Macrophages play an essential role in wound healing due to their dynamic
nature and functional plasticity, exhibiting highly heterogeneous
morpho-kinetic behaviors depending on their activation states. However,
quantitative analysis of macrophage behavior in in vivo settings remains
limited, largely due to the complexity of their diverse morphologies and
motility patterns over time. In this study, we present an analytic workflow to
investigate macrophage dynamics in zebrafish. By computing a comprehensive set
of morpho-kinetic features, we observe that M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2
(anti-inflammatory) macrophages exhibit distinct behaviors, such as reduced
shape elongation, more directed movement, and less random-like motion in M1
compared to M2 macrophages. Based on these features, we classify macrophages in
the transition period into M1-like and M2-like groups. We compare and analyze
their behaviors, which allows us to estimate the timing of the phenotypic
switch. In addition, macrophages not expressing Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are
located significantly farther from the wound compared to M1 macrophages. While
macrophages unstimulated by wound signaling exhibit some M2-like features, they
differ notably in shape elongation and migration speed. In summary, this study
provides a quantitative analysis of macrophage behavior during wound healing
and suggests distinct behavioral landscapes across different macrophage
activation states.

### [3] [Design of radiotelemetry systems for animal tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19331)
*Laila Kazimierski,Guillermo Abramson,Nicolás Catalano*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 设计并实现两种低成本、低重量的无线电遥测系统，用于测量小型动物在密集森林中的运动，克服卫星定位不可靠和植被衰减的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在卫星定位不可靠且植被衰减严重的密集森林中，追踪小型动物的运动具有挑战性。

Method: 两种方法均使用固定接收站记录动物携带的便携发射器信号：一种测量接收功率，另一种记录双天线站的相位差。后者克服了功率法测距的困难。

Result: 系统成功用于记录南美洲负鼠Dromiciops gliroides的运动，该物种在巴塔哥尼亚安第斯生态系统中扮演重要角色。

Conclusion: 提出的无线电遥测系统为密集森林中小型动物运动研究提供了可靠的低成本解决方案。

Abstract: We describe the design and implementation of two low-cost, low-weight,
radiotelemetry systems to measure the movement of small animals in a dense
forest, where satellite positioning systems are unreliable and the attenuation
of the vegetation poses several challenges. Both methods use stationary
receiving stations that record the signal emitted by a portable transmitter
carried by the animal. One of the methods measures the received power, while
the other one registers the phase difference received by two-antennas stations.
The later overcomes several difficulties that exist in the determination of the
distance by the power method. We used our system to record the movement of
Dromiciops gliroides, a vulnerable South American marsupial native of the
Patagonian Andes, where it plays an important role in the ecosystem.

### [4] [Estimating Sensitivity Maps for X-Nuclei Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18850)
*Nicholas Dwork,Jeremy W. Gordon,Shuyu Tang,Peder E. Z. Larson*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种称为L2最优方法的新技术，用于估计X核成像中的灵敏度图，相比常用的RefPeak方法，L2方法能更准确地提取信息并提高信噪比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在X核成像中，灵敏度图的准确估计对于成像质量至关重要，尤其是在目标核素分布不均匀的情况下。

Method: 通过解决最小二乘问题，利用光谱、动态成像或频谱激励的多个数据点来估计每个体素的灵敏度。

Result: L2最优方法在数值模型和实际器官（脑、胰腺、心脏）成像中均表现出更高的准确性和信噪比。

Conclusion: L2最优方法通过更有效地利用测量数据，显著提升了灵敏度图的估计质量。

Abstract: The purpose of this research is to estimate sensitivity maps when imaging
X-nuclei that may not have a significant presence throughout the field of view.
We propose to estimate the coil's sensitivities by solving a least-squares
problem where each row corresponds to an individual estimate of the sensitivity
for a given voxel. Multiple estimates come from the multiple bins of the
spectrum with spectroscopy, multiple times with dynamic imaging, or multiple
frequencies when utilizing spectral excitation. The method presented in this
manuscript, called the L2 optimal method, is compared to the commonly used
RefPeak method which uses the spectral bin with the highest energy to estimate
the sensitivity maps. The L2 optimal method yields more accurate sensitivity
maps when imaging a numerical phantom and is shown to yield a higher
signal-to-noise ratio when imaging the brain, pancreas, and heart with
hyperpolarized pyruvate as the contrast agent with hyperpolarized MRI. The L2
optimal method is able to better estimate the sensitivity by extracting more
information from the measurements.
