Traditional prognostic methods based on clinicopathological\nvariables alone do not fully capture the biological complexity of the disease.\nThis study aims to develop a risk scoring system based on genes associated with\ntumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC-associated genes) to improve prognostic\nassessment in CRC.\n  Methods: RNA-seq gene expression and clinicopathological data from TCGA-CRC\n(647 tumor samples, 51 normal tissues) were analyzed to identify differentially\nexpressed TIIC-associated genes through comparison with the CIBERSORTx\ndatabase. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to screen for\nprognostic markers. A Gaussian mixture model was applied to cluster prognostic\nmodels and select the model with the most robust gene combination. The\nresulting risk scoring system was validated in an external cohort (GSE39582)\nand integrated with clinicopathological variables to develop a prognostic\nnomogram.\n  Results: From 128 TIIC-associated genes, an optimal prognostic model\ncomprising CCL8 and TYR was identified. The risk score was calculated as\n0.152*Exp(CCL8) - 0.516*Exp(TYR). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significant\nsurvival differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in both TCGA-CRC (p\n< 0.05) and GSE39582 (p < 0.05). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed AUC values\nranging from 0.605 to 0.696 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in TCGA-CRC\nand GSE39582. Multivariate Cox analysis identified TNM_T, TNM_N, and risk score\nas independent prognostic factors.\n  Conclusion: Our risk scoring system based on CCL8 and TYR effectively\nstratifies CRC patients into distinct prognostic groups and could guide\ntreatment decisions, particularly when integrated with TNM staging in a\nnomogram.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80bf\u7624\u6d78\u6da6\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u56e0\uff08CCL8\u548cTYR\uff09\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u7684\u9884\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u540e\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7RNA-seq\u548cCIBERSORTx\u5206\u6790\u7b5b\u9009\u9884\u540e\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eCCL8\u548cTYR\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eTNM\u5206\u671f\u7ed3\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u540e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5c42\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TNM\u5206\u671f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

In this study, we present an analytic workflow to\ninvestigate macrophage dynamics in zebrafish. By computing a comprehensive set\nof morpho-kinetic features, we observe that M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2\n(anti-inflammatory) macrophages exhibit distinct behaviors, such as reduced\nshape elongation, more directed movement, and less random-like motion in M1\ncompared to M2 macrophages. Based on these features, we classify macrophages in\nthe transition period into M1-like and M2-like groups. We compare and analyze\ntheir behaviors, which allows us to estimate the timing of the phenotypic\nswitch. In addition, macrophages not expressing Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are\nlocated significantly farther from the wound compared to M1 macrophages. While\nmacrophages unstimulated by wound signaling exhibit some M2-like features, they\ndiffer notably in shape elongation and migration speed.
