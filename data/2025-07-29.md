### [1] [Theoretical modeling and quantitative research on aquatic ecosystems driven by multiple factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19553)
*Haizhao Guan,Yiyuan Niu,Chuanjin Zu,Ju Kang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究通过多年实地监测，开发了一个多因素交互模型，揭示了总氮、总磷和水温对叶绿素a动态的显著影响，为淡水生态系统健康管理提供了理论支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决现有研究对叶绿素a动态与环境因素关系的简化问题，强调非线性和长期时间变化的影响。

Method: 通过2020-2024年对广东三个水体的总氮、总磷、水温和叶绿素a的监测，开发了多因素交互模型。

Result: 研究发现叶绿素a浓度具有显著的时空变异性，与总氮、总磷和水温呈强正相关，且总氮比总磷对叶绿素a增长的影响更大。

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions between water temperature, nutrient
levels, and chlorophyll-a dynamics is essential for addressing eutrophication
and the proliferation of harmful algal blooms in freshwater ecosystems algal.
However, many existing studies tend to oversimplify thse relationships often
neglecting the non-linear effects and long-term temporal variations that
influence chlorophyll-a growth. Here, we conducted multi-year field monitoring
(2020-2024) of the key environmental factors, including total nitrogen (TN),
total phosphorus (TP), water temperature, and chlorophyll-a, across three water
bodies in Guangdong Province, China: Tiantangshan Reservoir(S1), Baisha River
Reservoir(S2) and Meizhou Reservoir(S3). Based on the collected data, we
developed a multi-factor interaction model to quantitatively assess the
spatiotemporal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and its environmental drivers. Our
research reveal significant temporal and spatial variability in chlorophyll-a
concentrations, with strong positive correlations to TN, TP, and water
temperature. Long-term data from S1 and S2 demonstrate a clear trend of
increasing eutrophication, with TN emerging as a more influential factor than
TP in chlorophyll-a proliferation. The developed model accurately reproduces
observed patterns, offering a robust theoretical basis for future predictive
and management-oriented studies of aquatic ecosystem health.

### [2] [Review of Deep Learning Applications to Structural Proteomics Enabled by Cryogenic Electron Microscopy and Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19565)
*Brady K. Zhou,Jason J. Hu,Jane K. J. Lee,Z. Hong Zhou,Demetri Terzopoulos*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 深度学习在冷冻电镜（cryoEM）和冷冻电子断层扫描（cryoET）中的应用显著提升了结构解析的效率和精度，解决了噪声、取向偏差等问题，并实现了自动化建模。


<details>

Conclusion: 深度学习将继续推动冷冻电镜技术的自动化和普及，有望彻底改变对生物大分子结构和功能的理解。

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.

### [3] [Inference for stochastic reaction networks via logistic regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19979)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决化学反应网络建模中网络结构和参数推断的挑战，尤其是在催化物种难以识别的情况下。

Method: 使用多项式逻辑回归框架推断化学计量和网络结构，并结合贝叶斯逻辑回归与微分方程模型处理部分可观测数据。

Result: 方法能够恢复完整的网络结构，包括化学计量关系，并在COVID-19案例中成功推断SIR模型参数。

Conclusion: 简单的基于似然的技术（如逻辑回归）可以从合成和实证时间序列数据中提取有意义的机制信息。

Abstract: Identifying network structure and inferring parameters are central challenges
in modeling chemical reaction networks. In this study, we propose
likelihood-based methods grounded in multinomial logistic regression to infer
both stoichiometries and network connectivity structure from full time-series
trajectories of stochastic chemical reaction networks. When complete molecular
count trajectories are observed for all species, stoichiometric coefficients
are identifiable, provided each reaction occurs at least once during the
observation window. However, identifying catalytic species remains difficult,
as their molecular counts remain unchanged before and after each reaction
event. Through three illustrative stochastic models involving catalytic
interactions in open networks, we demonstrate that the logistic regression
framework, when applied properly, can recover the full network structure,
including stoichiometric relationships. We further apply Bayesian logistic
regression to estimate model parameters in real-world epidemic settings, using
the COVID-19 outbreak in the Greater Seoul area of South Korea as a case study.
Our analysis focuses on a Susceptible--Infected--Recovered (SIR) network model
that incorporates demographic effects. To address the challenge of partial
observability, particularly the availability of data only for the infectious
subset of the population, we develop a method that integrates Bayesian logistic
regression with differential equation models. This approach enables robust
inference of key SIR parameters from observed COVID-19 case trajectories.
Overall, our findings demonstrate that simple, likelihood-based techniques such
as logistic regression can recover meaningful mechanistic insights from both
synthetic and empirical time-series data.

### [4] [Mathematical model of blood coagulation during endovenous laser therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20401)
*Anna A. Andreeva,Konstantin A. Klochkov,Alexey I. Lobanov*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个简单的点模型，用于模拟ELT过程中血液凝固的动力学，揭示了加热对凝血速率和纤维蛋白网络形成的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ELT过程中血栓形成的主要模式，并模拟EHIT，以减少并发症。

Method: 基于扩散限制假设，通过Stokes-Einstein方程重新计算反应速率，构建血液凝固的点模型。

Result: 加热导致凝血酶生成速率增加，峰值浓度时间缩短5-6倍，纤维蛋白网络细胞尺寸减小。

Conclusion: 模型为理解ELT中血栓形成机制提供了定量工具，数据可复现。

Abstract: Endovenous laser therapy (ELT) as a minimally invasive procedure for ablation
of large superficial veins, nevertheless, can cause complications of thrombotic
nature. In this regard, the study of the main patterns of thrombus formation
during ELT and modelling of endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is
relevant. Based on the assumption of diffusion limiting of biochemical
processes occurring during the coagulation of blood, by recalculating the
reaction rates according to the Stokes-Einstein equation, a simple point model
of blood coagulation during ELT was built in this paper. As a result of the use
of this model, it was demonstrated that blood heating entails an increase in
the rate of thrombin production, a decrease in the time for achieving the peak
of its concentration by 5-6 times with its almost constant amplitude. Heating
leads to the rapid formation of fibrin clusters and the appearance of a
fibrin-polymer network with a smaller cell size. The quantitative dependence on
the selected rheological model was also shown. All the data necessary for using
the model are given in this article for reproducibility.

### [5] [A Topology-Based Machine Learning Model Decisively Outperforms Flux Balance Analysis in Predicting Metabolic Gene Essentiality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20406)
*Justin Boone*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于代谢网络拓扑结构的机器学习方法，用于预测基因必需性，其性能显著优于传统的通量平衡分析（FBA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如FBA）在复杂代谢网络中预测基因必需性时表现不佳，作者假设网络拓扑结构能提供更稳健的预测信号。

Method: 通过构建反应-反应图，提取图论特征（如中介中心性和PageRank），并训练随机森林分类器，与FBA方法进行对比。

Result: 机器学习模型的F1分数为0.400，而FBA方法的F1分数为0.000，表明拓扑结构方法显著优于FBA。

Conclusion: 拓扑结构优先的机器学习方法在预测基因必需性上优于传统FBA，为处理生物冗余提供了新思路。

Abstract: Background: The rational identification of essential genes is a cornerstone
of drug discovery, yet standard computational methods like Flux Balance
Analysis (FBA) often struggle to produce accurate predictions in complex,
redundant metabolic networks. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the topological
structure of a metabolic network contains a more robust predictive signal for
essentiality than functional simulations alone. Methodology: To test this
hypothesis, we developed a machine learning pipeline by first constructing a
reaction-reaction graph from the e_coli_core metabolic model. Graph-theoretic
features, including betweenness centrality and PageRank, were engineered to
describe the topological role of each gene. A RandomForestClassifier was
trained on these features, and its performance was rigorously benchmarked
against a standard FBA single-gene deletion analysis using a curated
ground-truth dataset. Results: Our machine learning model achieved a solid
predictive performance with an F1-Score of 0.400 (Precision: 0.412, Recall:
0.389). In profound contrast, the standard FBA baseline method failed to
correctly identify any of the known essential genes, resulting in an F1-Score
of 0.000. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a "structure-first" machine
learning approach is a significantly superior strategy for predicting gene
essentiality compared to traditional FBA on the E. coli core network. By
learning the topological signatures of critical network roles, our model
successfully overcomes the known limitations of simulation-based methods in
handling biological redundancy. While the performance of topology-only models
is expected to face challenges on more complex genome-scale networks, this
validated framework represents a significant step forward and highlights the
primacy of network architecture in determining biological function.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于术前临床参数和影像特征的机器学习模型，用于预测结直肠肝转移患者的术后复发风险，3个月预测模型的AUC为0.723，具有临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床模型在预测结直肠肝转移患者预后时准确性不足，需要更可靠的预测工具。

Method: 使用术前基线临床参数和CT影像的放射组学特征，开发机器学习模型，避免术后特征导致的数据泄漏风险。

Result: 3个月复发预测模型表现最佳（AUC 0.723），决策曲线分析显示其临床实用性优于“全治疗”或“不治疗”策略。

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了具有临床价值的早期复发预测模型，并提出了避免数据泄漏的严格框架，提升了模型的可靠性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)
remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models.
This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for
predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved
exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative
features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we
restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and
radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting
recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month
recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of
0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across
threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater
net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility
in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study
successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with
confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of
data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework
to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in
real-world settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Segment Transformer的深度学习框架，用于高效预测酶的温度稳定性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发具有理想热稳定性的酶对工业和科研应用至关重要，但实验测定热参数耗时耗力，现有计算方法受限于数据不足和不平衡分布。

Method: 利用精心整理的温度稳定性数据集，提出了Segment Transformer框架，通过片段级表示预测酶的热稳定性。

Result: 模型在RMSE、MAE和相关性指标上表现优异，实验验证表明其指导的酶工程改造提升了1.64倍的相对活性。

Conclusion: Segment Transformer为酶热稳定性预测提供了高效工具，并展示了在酶工程中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌是第二大男性恶性肿瘤，需要先进的诊断工具。

Method: 结合BERT（处理临床文本）和随机森林（处理实验室数值数据），采用多模态融合策略。

Result: 在PLCO-NIH数据集上表现优异（98%准确率，99% AUC），尤其对中期癌症阶段（Class 2/3）召回率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能、计算效率和临床可解释性之间取得平衡，满足前列腺癌诊断的关键需求。

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced
diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for
textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance
rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value.
This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance
(F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing
critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于蛋白质子序列重排序的新方法，用于零样本化合物-蛋白质相互作用预测，解决了现有方法在数据稀缺和计算资源需求上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测化合物-蛋白质相互作用时，忽视了蛋白质子序列间的复杂依赖关系，且依赖大规模数据集，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过蛋白质子序列重排序预训练蛋白质表示，并结合长度可变的蛋白质增强技术，提升小数据集上的预训练性能。

Result: 在零样本场景下显著提升了基线模型的性能，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现优于现有预训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物开发中的实际挑战提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种非参数方法，用于研究层次参数估计框架中的实际可识别性，并验证其在药理学和病毒动力学中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管层次参数估计在药理学建模中已成为标准，但现有的参数可识别性技术并未直接适用于层次设置。

Method: 采用非参数方法，在非线性混合效应框架下研究实际可识别性，并通过两个经典案例验证。

Result: 方法在药理学和病毒动力学案例中展示了潜在实用性。

Conclusion: 非参数方法为层次参数估计中的可识别性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mathematical modelling is a widely used approach to understand and interpret
clinical trial data. This modelling typically involves fitting mechanistic
mathematical models to data from individual trial participants. Despite the
widespread adoption of this individual-based fitting, it is becoming
increasingly common to take a hierarchical approach to parameter estimation,
where modellers characterize the population parameter distributions, rather
than considering each individual independently. This hierarchical parameter
estimation is standard in pharmacometric modelling. However, many of the
existing techniques for parameter identifiability do not immediately translate
from the individual-based fitting to the hierarchical setting. Here, we propose
a nonparametric approach to study practical identifiability within a
hierarchical parameter estimation framework. We focus on the commonly used
nonlinear mixed effects framework and investigate two well-studied examples
from the pharmacometrics and viral dynamics literature to illustrate the
potential utility of our approach.

Motivation: 探索骑行中肌肉协调的神经控制策略和运动效率。

Method: 20名休闲骑行者进行分级骑行测试，记录七块下肢肌肉的肌电图，提取肌肉协同并计算共激活和协同指数。

Result: 功率增加时，膝关节共激活减少，踝关节增加；协同空间减小，神经肌肉协调改善。

Conclusion: 结合协同和共激活指数可评估运动控制，助力康复和骑行表现优化。

Abstract: Assessment of muscle coordination during cycling may provide insight into
motor control strategies and movement efficiency. This study evaluated muscle
synergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination
in lower-limb across three power levels of cycling. Twenty recreational
cyclists performed a graded cycling test on a stationary bicycle ergometer.
Electromyography was recorded bilaterally from seven lower-limb muscles and
muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. The
Coactivation Index (CI), Synergy Index (SI), and Synergy Coordination Index
(SCI) were calculated to assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle
synergies were identified consistently across power levels, with changes in
synergy composition and activation timing correlated with increased muscular
demands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at
the knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a
greater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those
of the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the relative EMG contribution
of hip extensor and flexor muscles remained consistent with increasing power
levels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting
a reduction in the size of the synergy space and improved neuromuscular
coordination. These findings provide insight into how the central nervous
system modulates its response to increasing mechanical demands. Combining
synergy and coactivation indices offers a promising approach to assess motor
control, inform rehabilitation, and optimize performance in cycling tasks.
