Here, we conducted multi-year field monitoring\n(2020-2024) of the key environmental factors, including total nitrogen (TN),\ntotal phosphorus (TP), water temperature, and chlorophyll-a, across three water\nbodies in Guangdong Province, China: Tiantangshan Reservoir(S1), Baisha River\nReservoir(S2) and Meizhou Reservoir(S3). Based on the collected data, we\ndeveloped a multi-factor interaction model to quantitatively assess the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and its environmental drivers. Our\nresearch reveal significant temporal and spatial variability in chlorophyll-a\nconcentrations, with strong positive correlations to TN, TP, and water\ntemperature. Long-term data from S1 and S2 demonstrate a clear trend of\nincreasing eutrophication, with TN emerging as a more influential factor than\nTP in chlorophyll-a proliferation.

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the topological\nstructure of a metabolic network contains a more robust predictive signal for\nessentiality than functional simulations alone. Methodology: To test this\nhypothesis, we developed a machine learning pipeline by first constructing a\nreaction-reaction graph from the e_coli_core metabolic model. Graph-theoretic\nfeatures, including betweenness centrality and PageRank, were engineered to\ndescribe the topological role of each gene. A RandomForestClassifier was\ntrained on these features, and its performance was rigorously benchmarked\nagainst a standard FBA single-gene deletion analysis using a curated\nground-truth dataset. Results: Our machine learning model achieved a solid\npredictive performance with an F1-Score of 0.400 (Precision: 0.412, Recall:\n0.389). In profound contrast, the standard FBA baseline method failed to\ncorrectly identify any of the known essential genes, resulting in an F1-Score\nof 0.000. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a \"structure-first\" machine\nlearning approach is a significantly superior strategy for predicting gene\nessentiality compared to traditional FBA on the E. coli core network. By\nlearning the topological signatures of critical network roles, our model\nsuccessfully overcomes the known limitations of simulation-based methods in\nhandling biological redundancy. While the performance of topology-only models\nis expected to face challenges on more complex genome-scale networks, this\nvalidated framework represents a significant step forward and highlights the\nprimacy of network architecture in determining biological function.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8c22\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u56e0\u5fc5\u9700\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u6790\uff08FBA\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982FBA\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u8c22\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u56e0\u5fc5\u9700\u6027\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53cd\u5e94-\u53cd\u5e94\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u548cPageRank\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4e0eFBA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.400\uff0c\u800cFBA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.000\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eFBA\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u56e0\u5fc5\u9700\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFBA\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u751f\u7269\u5197\u4f59\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This study evaluated muscle\nsynergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination\nin lower-limb across three power levels of cycling.

The\nCoactivation Index (CI), Synergy Index (SI), and Synergy Coordination Index\n(SCI) were calculated to assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle\nsynergies were identified consistently across power levels, with changes in\nsynergy composition and activation timing correlated with increased muscular\ndemands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at\nthe knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a\ngreater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those\nof the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the relative EMG contribution\nof hip extensor and flexor muscles remained consistent with increasing power\nlevels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting\na reduction in the size of the synergy space and improved neuromuscular\ncoordination.

Although existing methods perform adequately\nduring certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)\nRepresentation learning from local or complete protein sequences often\noverlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are\nessential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)\nDependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands\nsignificant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\npretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence\nreordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.\nFurthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent\npretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's\neffectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various\nbaseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the\nbaseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging\nzero-shot scenario.
