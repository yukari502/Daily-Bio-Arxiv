The dataset suffers from egregious\ndata leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws\nthat invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491\ninactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more\nrepeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).\nCritically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test\ncases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.\nStructural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of\nquery ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1\nalone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation\nsets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws\ncollectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than\ngeneralize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,\nwe implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no\nphysics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including\ndeep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these\nartifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and\ncall into question previous results based on its use.
