TL;DR: 研究探讨了活动记录仪（actigraphy）衍生的睡眠和活动特征与跨诊断精神病样本中症状严重程度的相关性，发现晚起时间和轻度活动与抑郁和焦虑症状显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精神病症状评分量表依赖自我报告且预测能力有限，活动记录仪提供客观、高分辨率的行为数据，可能更好地反映症状波动。

Method: 对8名门诊患者进行可行性案例系列研究，使用GENEActiv活动记录仪收集数据，并通过多种验证量表测量症状严重程度，进行个体内和个体间的相关性分析。

Result: 晚起时间与更高的抑郁和焦虑症状评分显著相关，而轻度活动增加与抑郁症状减轻相关。

Conclusion: 活动记录仪特征与症状的关联表明其在临床监测中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Background: Symptom rating scales in psychiatry are limited by reliance on
self-report, and lack of predictive power. Actigraphy, a passive wearable-based
method for measuring sleep and physical activity, offers objective,
high-resolution behavioral data that may better reflect symptom fluctuations,
but most studies have focused on narrow diagnostic groups or fixed time
windows, limiting clinical translation. Objective: To examine whether
actigraphy-derived sleep and activity features correlate with psychiatric
symptom severity in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample, and to identify which
features are most clinically relevant across multiple temporal resolutions.
Methods: We present a feasibility case series study with preliminary data from
eight outpatients enrolled in the DeeP-DD study, a transdiagnostic study of
digital phenotyping. Participants wore GENEActiv actigraphy devices and symptom
severity was measured using a variety of validated scales. We performed
intra-individual Spearman correlations and inter-individual repeated measures
correlations across daily, weekly, monthly, and full-duration averages.
Results: Intra-individual analyses revealed that later rise times were
significantly associated with higher weekly PHQ-9 scores in participant #7
(\r{ho} = 0.74, P=.0003) and participant #4 (\r{ho} = 0.78, P=.022), as well as
higher weekly GAD-7 scores in participant #7 (\r{ho} = 0.59, P=.026).
Inter-individual analyses showed that weeks with later average rise time
correlated with higher PHQ-9 (r = 0.48, P=.0003) and GAD-7 scores (r = 0.38,
P=.032). Increased light physical activity was linked to lower PHQ-9 scores
weekly (r = -0.44, P=.001) and monthly (r = -0.53, P=.014). Conclusion:
Consistent associations between actigraphy features and symptoms across
temporal scales and diagnostic groups underscore their potential utility for
scalable, real-world clinical monitoring.

### [2] [Pathology Foundation Models are Scanner Sensitive: Benchmark and Mitigation with Contrastive ScanGen Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22092)

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ScanGen的对比损失函数，用于减少计算病理学中深度学习模型的扫描仪偏差，提升模型在不同扫描仪间的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在计算病理学中表现优异，但容易受到扫描仪引入的无关细节影响，导致扫描仪偏差，影响临床信任和实际应用。

Method: 提出ScanGen对比损失函数，在任务特定微调中应用，以减少扫描仪偏差。实验基于多扫描仪数据集和EGFR突变预测任务。

Result: ScanGen显著提升了模型在不同扫描仪间的泛化能力，同时保持或改进了EGFR突变预测性能。

Conclusion: ScanGen有效解决了扫描仪偏差问题，增强了计算病理学模型的临床适用性。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining
actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been
at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,
it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those
introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This
may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired
by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in
CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent
pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a
multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.
Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function
applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby
enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied
to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe
that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while
retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

### [3] [Scaling and Data Saturation in Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22210)
*Aviv Spinner,Erika DeBenedictis,Corey M. Hudson*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文研究了蛋白质语言模型（pLMs）在不断增加预训练数据时的性能表现，发现性能虽非单调提升但持续改善，且无饱和迹象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物学数据冗余、噪声多且稀疏，研究数据规模和类型如何影响模型性能。

Method: 通过使用2011至2024年UniRef100的年快照预训练pLMs，测量蛋白质功能预测性能。

Result: 性能随数据增加而提升，但非单调，且无监督与有监督实验表现不同。无监督模型逐年改进，但未超过有监督基线。

Conclusion: 需针对性数据采集和更深入研究数据规模对蛋白质建模的影响。

Abstract: Data in biology is redundant, noisy, and sparse. How does the type and scale
of available data impact model performance? In this work, we specifically
investigate how protein language models (pLMs) scale with increasing
pretraining data. We investigate this relationship by measuring the performance
of protein function prediction on a suite of pLMs pretrained on yearly
snapshots of UniRef100 from 2011 to 2024. We find no evidence of model
saturation on this task: performance improves--but not monotonically--with
added data, and this trend differs between unsupervised and supervised
experiments. Using a well-characterized Beta-Lactamase protein from E. coli, we
find that unsupervised model predictions get better year-over-year, though they
do not yet consistently perform better than the supervised baseline. Our
results underscore the need for targeted data acquisition and deeper study of
data scaling in protein modeling. All training, inference, analysis, and
visualization code is available at:

### [4] [Evaluating Integrative Strategies for Incorporating Phenotypic Features in Spatial Transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22212)
*Levin M Moser,Ahmad Kamal Hamid,Esteban Miglietta,Nodar Gogoberidze,Beth A Cimini*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用变分自编码器（VAE）从空间转录组学数据中提取低维表示，并与成像数据整合，提升生物学信号的分析效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术为生物样本的空间分析提供了新机会，但如何有效利用空间信息并整合成像数据仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 使用公开的小鼠回肠MERFISH数据集，评估了VAE在多种输入（如转录计数、核染色、膜染色）下提取低维表示的能力，并与传统方法（CellProfiler）比较。

Result: VAE提取的潜在空间（LSs）能捕捉有意义的生物学变异，提升特定细胞类型的分类效果，且与转录计数结合可提高聚类同质性。

Conclusion: 即使在受限条件下，VAE也能从成像数据中提取生物学信号，是多模态整合的有前景策略。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies not only offer an unprecedented
opportunity to interrogate intact biological samples in a spatially informed
manner, but also set the stage for integration with other imaging-based
modalities. However, how to best exploit spatial context and integrate ST with
imaging-based modalities remains an open question. To address this,
particularly under real-world experimental constraints such as limited dataset
size, class imbalance, and bounding-box-based segmentation, we used a publicly
available murine ileum MERFISH dataset to evaluate whether a minimally tuned
variational autoencoder (VAE) could extract informative low-dimensional
representations from cell crops of spot counts, nuclear stain, membrane stain,
or a combination thereof. We assessed the resulting embeddings through
PERMANOVA, cross-validated classification, and unsupervised Leiden clustering,
and compared them to classical image-based feature vectors extracted via
CellProfiler. While transcript counts (TC) generally outperformed other feature
spaces, the VAE-derived latent spaces (LSs) captured meaningful biological
variation and enabled improved label recovery for specific cell types. LS2, in
particular, trained solely on morphological input, also exhibited moderate
predictive power for a handful of genes in a ridge regression model. Notably,
combining TC with LSs through multiplex clustering led to consistent gains in
cluster homogeneity, a trend that also held when augmenting only subsets of TC
with the stain-derived LS2. In contrast, CellProfiler-derived features
underperformed relative to LSs, highlighting the advantage of learned
representations over hand-crafted features. Collectively, these findings
demonstrate that even under constrained conditions, VAEs can extract
biologically meaningful signals from imaging data and constitute a promising
strategy for multi-modal integration.

### [5] [Spatiodynamic inference using vision-based generative modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22256)
*Jun Won Park,Kangyu Zhao,Sanket Rane*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉变换器和变分编码的模拟推理框架，用于复杂时空数据的参数推断，保留数据的完整性和依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过降维牺牲数据的复杂性和依赖性，限制了从时空数据中提取机制性见解的能力。

Method: 使用视觉变换器驱动的变分编码生成数据的紧凑表示，结合无似然贝叶斯方法进行参数推断。

Result: 框架能够识别多元动态系统中的时空模式，保留数据的完整结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂时空数据的分析提供了统一的推理框架，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Biological systems commonly exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns whose
underlying generative mechanisms pose a significant analytical challenge.
Traditional approaches to spatiodynamic inference rely on dimensionality
reduction through summary statistics, which sacrifice complexity and
interdependent structure intrinsic to these data in favor of parameter
identifiability. This imposes a fundamental constraint on reliably extracting
mechanistic insights from spatiotemporal data, highlighting the need for
analytical frameworks that preserve the full richness of these dynamical
systems. To address this, we developed a simulation-based inference framework
that employs vision transformer-driven variational encoding to generate compact
representations of the data, exploiting the inherent contextual dependencies.
These representations are subsequently integrated into a likelihood-free
Bayesian approach for parameter inference. The central idea is to construct a
fine-grained, structured mesh of latent representations from simulated dynamics
through systematic exploration of the parameter space. This encoded mesh of
latent embeddings then serves as a reference map for retrieving parameter
values that correspond to observed data. By integrating generative modeling
with Bayesian principles, our approach provides a unified inference framework
to identify both spatial and temporal patterns that manifest in multivariate
dynamical systems.

### [6] [Deep learning of geometrical cell division rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22587)
*Alexandre Durrmeyer,Jean-Christophe Palauqui,Philippe Andrey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数据的方法，利用深度学习研究细胞几何形状与分裂平面定位的关系，解决了传统几何规则的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖先验的几何规则，限制了细胞分裂模式的研究。作者希望通过数据驱动的方法更全面地理解细胞几何与分裂平面的关系。

Method: 采用改进的UNet架构，基于细胞掩模图像，从母细胞几何形状中学习和预测分裂模式。

Result: 模型在合成数据和拟南芥胚胎细胞上表现良好，能够解释传统几何规则无法涵盖的分裂模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习在理解细胞分裂模式和生成新假设方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于量子计算的方法（PQK）来解决CAR T细胞设计中的组合优化问题，展示了量子计算在数据受限问题中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAR T细胞设计中的组合空间巨大且实验数据有限，传统方法难以有效探索。

Method: 使用投影量子核（PQK）将经典数据嵌入高维希尔伯特空间，并通过核方法测量样本相似性。

Result: 在61量子比特的门控量子计算机上实现了最大的PQK应用，分类性能优于经典机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 量子计算在数据受限的CAR T细胞设计中表现出优势，特别是在信息较少的情况下。

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.
