Motivation: 随着scATAC-seq、scCUT&Tag和scBS-seq在CAR-T细胞状态分析中的应用增加，需要定制化的QC工具来检测CAR载体插入位点的信号。

Method: 支持10x和非10x数据格式，生成HTML和PNG格式的总结报告，适用于探索性分析和临床前报告。

Result: 帮助研究人员、核心设施和转化免疫学家确保工程化T细胞的单细胞表观基因组分析的有效性。

Conclusion: CARTEpigenoQC为CAR-T细胞的单细胞表观基因组数据提供了高效的质量控制解决方案。

Abstract: CARTEpigenoQC is an R-based toolkit designed to streamline quality control
(QC) for single-cell epigenomic datasets involving Chimeric Antigen Receptor
(CAR)-engineered T cells. With the growing application of scATAC-seq,
scCUT&Tag, and scBS-seq to characterize CAR-T cell states, it has become
critical to perform customized QC that not only addresses standard metrics like
FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks) and TSS enrichment, but also directly detects
signal from CAR vector insertion sites. CARTEpigenoQC supports both 10x
Genomics and non-10x data formats and produces HTML and PNG summary outputs
suited for exploratory analysis and regulatory-grade preclinical reporting. It
is intended to assist researchers, core facilities, and translational
immunologists in ensuring the validity of single-cell epigenomic profiling of
engineered T cells.

### [2] [The Lipid Interactome: An interactive and open access platform for exploring cellular lipid-protein interactomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23101)
*Gaelen Guzman,André Nadler,Frank Stein,Jeremy M. Baskin,Carsten Schultz,Fikadu Tafesse*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Lipid Interactome数据库，旨在整合和标准化脂质-蛋白质相互作用数据，提供交互式分析工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脂质-蛋白质相互作用在细胞信号传导和膜动力学中至关重要，但缺乏统一的数据整合平台。

Method: 通过功能化脂质探针和蛋白质组学技术，结合FAIR数据原则，构建交互式数据库。

Result: Lipid Interactome数据库实现了脂质相互作用数据的集中化、标准化和可视化。

Conclusion: 该数据库为研究脂质生物学功能提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Lipid-protein interactions play essential roles in cellular signaling and
membrane dynamics, yet their systematic characterization has long been hindered
by the inherent biochemical properties of lipids. Recent advances in
functionalized lipid probes -- equipped with photoactivatable crosslinkers,
affinity handles, and photocleavable protecting groups -- have enabled
proteomics-based identification of lipid interacting proteins with
unprecedented specificity and resolution. Despite the growing number of
published lipid interactomes, there remains no centralized effort to harmonize,
compare, or integrate these datasets.
  The Lipid Interactome addresses this gap by providing a structured,
interactive web portal that adheres to FAIR data principles -- ensuring that
lipid interactome studies are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable. Through standardized data formatting, interactive visualizations, and
direct cross-study comparisons, this resource enables researchers to
systematically explore the protein-binding partners of diverse bioactive
lipids. By consolidating and curating lipid interactome proteomics data from
multiple studies, the Lipid Interactome database serves as a critical tool for
deciphering the biological functions of lipids in cellular systems.

### [3] [Lightweight Language Models are Prone to Reasoning Errors for Complex Computational Phenotyping Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23146)
*Sarah Pungitore,Shashank Yadav,David Maughan,Vignesh Subbian*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs在计算表型任务中的表现，发现其在复杂任务中存在推理错误，并扩展了PHEONA框架以评估这些错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算表型任务耗时且需要人工审查，LLMs在单疗法表型分类中表现良好，但在多疗法表型分类中表现不佳，因此需要研究其推理错误。

Method: 评估了三种轻量级LLMs（DeepSeek-r1、Mistral Small、Phi-4）在有无提示修改下的表现，重点关注解释正确性和不忠实错误。

Result: 所有模型均存在推理错误，DeepSeek在提示修改后准确性影响最小。扩展的PHEONA框架为评估LLMs提供了关键支持。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂推理任务中普遍存在推理错误，需进一步开发解释性方法以理解错误原因。

Abstract: Objective: Although computational phenotyping is a central informatics
activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications, it
is time-intensive because of manual data review. We previously assessed the
ability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable
phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed
concept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but
underperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these
complex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of
LLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning.
Materials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs
(DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both
with and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and
unfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt
modifications, both errors were present across all models although more
responses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For
experiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a
reasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to
Mistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across
models, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty
reasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for
reasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can
help prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors
occur will likely require further development and refinement of
interpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across
LLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task

TL;DR: TAP-GPT利用TableGPT2和LLMs的先验知识，通过结构化生物标志物数据实现阿尔茨海默病的早期准确诊断，优于通用LLMs和TFM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期准确诊断需要分析多种异构生物标志物，LLMs因其多模态整合和自然语言解释能力提供了新机会。

Method: 提出TAP-GPT框架，基于TableGPT2，通过少样本提示和qLoRA微调，用于AD与认知正常（CN）的二元分类任务。

Result: TAP-GPT在结构化生物标志物数据上的表现优于通用LLMs和TFM。

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLMs应用于基于表格生物标志物数据的预测任务，为生物医学信息学中的多智能体框架铺平了道路。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.
