Abstract: While linear registration is a critical step in MRI preprocessing pipelines,
its numerical uncertainty is understudied. Using Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA)
simulations, we assessed the most commonly used linear registration tools
within major software packages (SPM, FSL, and ANTs) across multiple image
similarity measures, two brain templates, and both healthy control (HC, n=50)
and Parkinson's Disease (PD, n=50) cohorts. Our findings highlight the
influence of linear registration tools and similarity measures on numerical
stability. Among the evaluated tools and with default similarity measures, SPM
exhibited the highest stability. FSL and ANTs showed greater and similar ranges
of variability, with ANTs demonstrating particular sensitivity to numerical
perturbations that occasionally led to registration failure. Furthermore, no
significant differences were observed between healthy and PD cohorts,
suggesting that numerical stability analyses obtained with healthy subjects may
generalise to clinical populations. Finally, we also demonstrated how numerical
uncertainty measures may support automated quality control (QC) of linear
registration results. Overall, our experimental results characterize the
numerical stability of linear registration experimentally and can serve as a
basis for future uncertainty analyses.

Conclusion: 决定是否使用虚拟染色时，应考虑任务网络的能力。

Abstract: Virtual staining, or in-silico-labeling, has been proposed to computationally
generate synthetic fluorescence images from label-free images by use of deep
learning-based image-to-image translation networks. In most reported studies,
virtually stained images have been assessed only using traditional image
quality measures such as structural similarity or signal-to-noise ratio.
However, in biomedical imaging, images are typically acquired to facilitate an
image-based inference, which we refer to as a downstream biological or clinical
task. This study systematically investigates the utility of virtual staining
for facilitating clinically relevant downstream tasks (like segmentation or
classification) with consideration of the capacity of the deep neural networks
employed to perform the tasks. Comprehensive empirical evaluations were
conducted using biological datasets, assessing task performance by use of
label-free, virtually stained, and ground truth fluorescence images. The
results demonstrated that the utility of virtual staining is largely dependent
on the ability of the segmentation or classification task network to extract
meaningful task-relevant information, which is related to the concept of
network capacity. Examples are provided in which virtual staining does not
improve, or even degrades, segmentation or classification performance when the
capacity of the associated task network is sufficiently large. The results
demonstrate that task network capacity should be considered when deciding
whether to perform virtual staining.
