However, the field lacks comprehensive\nbenchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both\nhistology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a\nlarge-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial\ntranscriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene\npanels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and\ngene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed\ntheir effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and\ngene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression\nencoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and\nthat gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both\nthose trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,\ndownstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive\npretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it\ndegrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders\ntrained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key\nfactor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings\nhighlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in\nspatial transcriptomics.

Two quantitative indicators,\nfirst split time and final component count, are introduced to assess the timing\nand extent of group disintegration.

We have therefore used a recently developed and\nvalidated neural network (NN) model predicting surface nitrate concentrations\nfrom a range of observable variables and implemented its assimilation within a\nresearch and development version of the Met Office's NWES operational\nforecasting system. As a result of nitrate assimilation the phytoplankton\nforecast skill improves by up to 30%.
