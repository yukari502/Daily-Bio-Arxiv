Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: HESCAPE是一个用于空间转录组学中跨模态对比预训练的大规模基准测试，评估了图像和基因表达编码器的性能，发现基因表达编码器对表征对齐起主要作用，但对比预训练在基因突变分类和基因表达预测任务中表现矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学缺乏评估多模态学习方法的综合基准，HESCAPE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于6种基因面板和54名捐赠者的数据集，系统评估了图像和基因表达编码器在多种预训练策略下的表现，并测试了其在基因突变分类和基因表达预测任务中的效果。

Result: 基因表达编码器对表征对齐起主要作用，但对比预训练在基因突变分类中表现优异，而在基因表达预测中表现较差。批次效应是影响跨模态对齐的关键因素。

Conclusion: HESCAPE为空间转录组学提供了标准化数据集和评估工具，强调了批次鲁棒性多模态学习方法的重要性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression
and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular
organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive
benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both
histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a
large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial
transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene
panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and
gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed
their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and
gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression
encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and
that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both
those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,
downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive
pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it
degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders
trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key
factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings
highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in
spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release
HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and
benchmarking tools for the community

### [2] [A Bayesian approach to model uncertainty in single-cell genomic data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02061)
*Shanshan Ren,Thomas E. Bartlett,Lina Gerontogianni,Swati Chandna*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于变分贝叶斯的框架，用于单细胞基因组数据的聚类分析，通过贝叶斯高斯混合模型捕捉细胞过渡状态，并引入新的性能评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法无法充分捕捉细胞在分化或突变中的过渡状态，导致信息丢失，因此需要更灵活的模型来表征动态细胞身份。

Method: 采用变分贝叶斯框架和贝叶斯高斯混合模型，估计细胞与不同簇的概率关联，并引入误聚类率和AUC作为性能评估指标。

Result: 该方法能够捕捉细胞过渡状态，为神经发生和乳腺癌进展提供生物学见解，并支持差异表达分析和伪时间分析。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了单细胞数据的分辨率，为发育和疾病中的动态细胞身份提供了更细致的表征。

Abstract: Network models provide a powerful framework for analysing single-cell count
data, facilitating the characterisation of cellular identities, disease
mechanisms, and developmental trajectories. However, uncertainty modeling in
unsupervised learning with genomic data remains insufficiently explored.
Conventional clustering methods assign a singular identity to each cell,
potentially obscuring transitional states during differentiation or mutation.
This study introduces a variational Bayesian framework for clustering and
analysing single-cell genomic data, employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model
to estimate the probabilistic association of cells with distinct clusters. This
approach captures cellular transitions, yielding biologically coherent insights
into neurogenesis and breast cancer progression. The inferred clustering
probabilities enable further analyses, including Differential Expression
Analysis and pseudotime analysis. Furthermore, we propose utilising the
misclustering rate and Area Under the Curve in clustering scRNA-seq data as an
innovative metric to quantitatively evaluate overall clustering performance.
This methodological advancement enhances the resolution of single-cell data
analysis, enabling a more nuanced characterisation of dynamic cellular
identities in development and disease.

### [3] [Quantifying Fish School Fragmentation under Predation Using Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00953)
*Junyi Qi,Thorkil Casse,Masayoshi Harada,Linh Thi Hoai Nguyen,Ton Viet Ta*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究基于SDE模型，通过图论指标量化鱼群在捕食下的分裂动态，引入两个指标评估分裂时间和程度，分析参数和环境噪声对鱼群稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进一步研究鱼群在捕食下的分裂行为，量化其动态变化，为理解鱼群对捕食策略和环境噪声的响应提供定量基础。

Method: 基于SDE模型，引入图论指标（连通分量数），定义分裂时间和最终分量数，进行参数敏感性分析，并独立考察环境噪声的影响。

Result: 参数变化对两种捕食策略下的鱼群分裂影响不同，高环境噪声会降低鱼群凝聚力。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估鱼群对不同捕食策略和环境噪声的响应提供了结构化定量方法。

Abstract: This study builds upon our previously proposed stochastic differential
equation (SDE)-based model to further investigate fish school fragmentation
under predation. Specifically, we explore structural dynamics by incorporating
graph-theoretic metrics--namely, the number of connected components--to
quantify changes in prey school organization. Two quantitative indicators,
first split time and final component count, are introduced to assess the timing
and extent of group disintegration. Sensitivity analyses are performed on key
parameters to evaluate their influence on group stability under nearest attack
and center attack strategies. We independently examine the effect of
environmental noise on fish school cohesion. Simulation results show that
parameter changes impact fish school fragmentation differently under the two
predation strategies. High environmental noise also makes it difficult for the
school to stay cohesive. This framework provides a structured and quantitative
basis for assessing how fish schools respond to different predation strategies
and environmental noise levels.

### [4] [Inferring processes within dynamic forest models using hybrid modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01228)
*Maximilian Pichler,Yannek Käber*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合建模方法FINN，结合森林间隙模型和深度神经网络，以提高森林动态预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在新型气候条件下建模森林动态时，需要平衡基于过程的理解和实证灵活性。传统动态植被模型（DVM）因功能形式假设不准确而表现不佳。

Method: 引入Forest Informed Neural Networks（FINN），用深度神经网络（DNN）替代部分过程，并通过统一校准步骤优化模型。

Result: 在巴罗科罗拉多岛50公顷样地的案例中，FINN通过DNN替代生长过程，显著提升了预测性能和演替轨迹的准确性。

Conclusion: FINN为从数据推断森林动态和预测生态系统轨迹提供了灵活且有效的方法。

Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful
balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic
Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but
their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms.
Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly
from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in
estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural
Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model
with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are
then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step.
In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that
replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and
succession trajectories compared to a fully mechanistic version of FINN.
Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible,
improved functional form of growth, which we extracted from the DNN using
explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a
versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve
forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.

### [5] [Combining machine learning with data assimilation to improve the quality of phytoplankton forecasting in a shelf sea environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02400)
*Deep S Banerjee,Jozef Skakala,David Ford*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 结合机器学习和数据同化显著改善了西北欧陆架海域浮游植物的短期（1-5天）预报能力，通过同化神经网络预测的硝酸盐数据，预报技能提升30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决浮游植物预报在春末和夏季的偏差问题，尤其是硝酸盐浓度过高导致的偏差。

Method: 使用神经网络模型预测表面硝酸盐浓度，并将其同化到预报系统中。

Result: 硝酸盐同化使浮游植物预报技能提升30%，且动态数据优于气候学数据。

Conclusion: 混合机器学习与数据同化的方法可应用于近实时预报系统，并改善其他富营养化指标。

Abstract: We demonstrate that combining machine learning with data assimilation leads
to a major improvement in phytoplankton short-range (1-5 day) forecasts for the
North-West European Shelf (NWES) seas. We show that excess nitrate
concentrations are a major reason behind known biases in phytoplankton
forecasts during late Spring and Summer, which can grow fast with lead time.
Assimilating observations of nitrate would potentially help address this, but
NWES nitrate data are typically not available in sufficient abundance to be
effectively assimilated. We have therefore used a recently developed and
validated neural network (NN) model predicting surface nitrate concentrations
from a range of observable variables and implemented its assimilation within a
research and development version of the Met Office's NWES operational
forecasting system. As a result of nitrate assimilation the phytoplankton
forecast skill improves by up to 30%. We show that although much of this
improvement can be achieved by using a weekly nitrate climatology predicted by
the NN model, there is a clear advantage in using flow-dependent nitrate data.
We discuss the impacts of this improvement on a range of additional
eutrophication indicators, such as dissolved inorganic phosphorus and sea
bottom oxygen. We argue that it should be feasible to implement this hybrid
machine learning - data assimilation approach within the near-real time NWES
operational forecasting system.

### [6] [CITS: Nonparametric Statistical Causal Modeling for High-Resolution Neural Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01920)
*Rahul Biswas,SuryaNarayana Sripada,Somabha Mukherjee,Reza Abbasi-Asl*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: CITS是一种非参数方法，用于从高分辨率时间序列数据中推断因果神经回路，优于现有方法，并在小鼠视觉任务中揭示了生物相关的因果连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解信号如何在神经回路中传播是解析大脑计算的关键，但功能性连接无法揭示方向性或因果机制。

Method: CITS通过结构因果模型建模神经动态，使用高斯或无分布统计检验时间滞后的条件独立性，适用于非高斯和时间依赖数据。

Result: CITS在模拟数据中优于现有方法，并在小鼠视觉任务中发现了与实验文献一致的因果回路。

Conclusion: CITS能揭示生物学意义路径，并为未来实验研究提供假设。

Abstract: Understanding how signals propagate through neural circuits is central to
deciphering brain computation. While functional connectivity captures
statistical associations, it does not reveal directionality or causal
mechanisms. We introduce CITS (Causal Inference in Time Series), a
non-parametric method for inferring statistically causal neural circuitry from
high-resolution time series data. CITS models neural dynamics using a
structural causal model with arbitrary Markov order and tests for time-lagged
conditional independence using either Gaussian or distribution-free statistics.
Unlike classical Granger Causality, which assumes linear autoregressive models
and Gaussian noise, or the Peter-Clark algorithm, which assumes i.i.d. data and
no temporal structure, CITS handles temporally dependent, potentially
non-Gaussian data with flexible testing procedures. We prove consistency under
mild mixing assumptions and validate CITS on simulated linear, nonlinear, and
continuous-time recurrent neural network data, where it outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We then apply CITS to Neuropixels recordings from
mouse brain during visual tasks. CITS uncovers interpretable, stimulus-specific
causal circuits linking cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal regions, consistent
with experimental literature. It also reveals that neurons with similar
orientation selectivity indices are more likely to be causally connected. Our
results demonstrate the utility of CITS in uncovering biologically meaningful
pathways and generating hypotheses for future experimental studies.

### [7] [RinQ: Predicting central sites in proteins on current quantum computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01501)
*Shah Ishmam Mohtashim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: RinQ是一种混合量子-经典框架，用于识别蛋白质中功能关键残基，通过量子优化技术实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用量子优化技术改进蛋白质网络分析，识别关键残基。

Method: 将蛋白质结构建模为残基相互作用网络（RINs），并将中心性检测任务转化为QUBO问题，使用D-Wave的模拟退火求解。

Result: RinQ在多种蛋白质中识别出的关键残基与经典中心性基准一致，验证了方法的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了近期量子及量子启发方法在蛋白质网络分析中的潜力，为未来在真实量子硬件上扩展至更大系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying
functionally critical residues in proteins, utilizing techniques in quantum
optimization. To that end, protein structures are modeled as residue
interaction networks (RINs), and the centrality detection task is cast as a
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Solved using
D-Wave's simulated annealing, this approach is applied to a diverse set of
proteins, including small peptides and biologically significant regulatory
proteins. RinQ consistently finds residues that align with classical centrality
benchmarks, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the approach. This
work highlights the promise of near-term quantum and quantum-inspired methods
for advancing protein network analysis and lays the groundwork for future
extensions to larger systems using real quantum hardware.

### [8] [Quantum Optimal Control for Coherent Spin Dynamics of Radical Pairs via Pontryagin Maximum Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01806)
*Ugur G. Abdulla,Jose H. Rodrigues,Jean-Jacques Slotine*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文通过最大化生化反应中的三重态-单重态产率，设计外部电磁场形状以驱动自由基对到量子相干态。提出了一种基于薛定谔系统的优化控制方法，并开发了新的迭代庞特里亚金最大值原理（IPMP）方法。数值模拟验证了方法的收敛性和稳定性，结果显示单重态产率变化小于1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过优化外部电磁场形状，驱动自由基对的量子相干态，以探索磁感受作为量子生物现象的潜在实验途径。

Method: 采用薛定谔系统模型，结合Zeeman和超精细耦合相互作用项，通过滤波方程引入最优控制问题，并开发了IPMP方法进行优化控制。

Result: 数值模拟表明，IPMP方法具有收敛性和稳定性，单重态产率变化小于1%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为磁感受作为量子生物现象的潜在实验提供了新途径。

Abstract: This paper aims at devising the shape of the external electromagnetic field
which drives the spin dynamics of radical pairs to quantum coherent state
through maximization of the triplet-singlet yield in biochemical reactions. The
model is a Schr\"{o}dinger system with spin Hamiltonians given by the sum of
Zeeman interaction and hyperfine coupling interaction terms. We introduce a
one-parameter family of optimal control problems by coupling the
Schr\"{o}dinger system to a control field through filtering equations for the
electromagnetic field. Fr\'echet differentiability and the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle in Hilbert space is proved, and the bang-bang structure of the
optimal control is established. A new iterative Pontryagin Maximum Principle
(IPMP) method for the identification of the bang-bang optimal control is
developed. Numerical simulations based on IPMP and the gradient projection
method (GPM) in Hilbert spaces are pursued, and the convergence, stability and
the regularization effect are demonstrated. Comparative analysis of filtering
with regular optimal electromagnetic field versus non-filtering with bang-bang
optimal field ({\it Abdulla et al, Quantum Sci. Technol., {\bf9}, 4, 2024})
demonstrates the change of the maxima of the singlet yield is less than 1\%.
The results open a venue for a potential experimental work for the
magnetoreception as a manifestation of quantum biological phenomena.

TL;DR: 本文综述了大规模预训练生物声学基础模型，并评估了其在多任务中的迁移能力，发现不同模型在不同任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物声学自动分析对生物多样性监测和保护至关重要，需要能适应多样化任务的深度学习模型。

Method: 综述了生物声学表示学习，分析了模型架构、预训练方案和训练范式，并在BEANS和BirdSet基准上评估了模型性能。

Result: BirdMAE在BirdSet上表现最佳，BEATs$_{NLM}$在BEANS上略优，不同模型在不同任务中各有优势。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者选择适合的生物声学分类任务模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and
conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse
bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale
pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their
transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview
bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources
and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by
thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining
scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation
models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing
the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive
probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that
BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised
objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS,
BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model,
is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to
extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and
Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain
competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in
linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages
over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the
baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms
bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings
provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to
adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.

### [10] [FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01055)
*Xuan Liu,Siru Ouyang,Xianrui Zhong,Jiawei Han,Huimin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文介绍了FGBench数据集，包含625K个带有功能基团信息的分子性质推理问题，旨在提升大语言模型（LLMs）在化学任务中的细粒度推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多关注分子级别性质预测，忽略了功能基团（FG）信息的重要性。FG数据可提供分子结构与文本描述间的先验知识，帮助构建更具解释性和结构感知的LLMs。

Method: 构建FGBench数据集，包含精确标注的功能基团信息，涵盖245种功能基团的回归和分类任务，分为单功能基团影响、多功能基团交互和分子直接比较三类。

Result: 在7K精选数据上测试，当前LLMs在FG级别性质推理上表现不佳，表明需提升其化学任务推理能力。

Conclusion: FGBench为构建FG级别数据集提供了方法论框架，有助于LLMs理解分子结构与性质的细粒度关系，推动分子设计和药物发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset
and evaluation code are available at

TL;DR: CellForge是一个多智能体系统，用于从原始单细胞多组学数据自动构建优化的虚拟细胞模型，在扰动预测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物系统的复杂性、数据模态的异质性以及跨学科领域知识的缺乏，使得自主构建虚拟细胞模型具有挑战性。

Method: CellForge采用多智能体框架，包含任务分析、方法设计和实验执行三个核心模块，通过专家协作达成共识。

Result: 在六种不同数据集上的测试中，CellForge在单细胞扰动预测任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CellForge展示了多智能体协作在解决复杂建模问题中的优势，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/gersteinlab/CellForge.
