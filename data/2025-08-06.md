*Vinil Polepalli*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类别条件变分自编码器（cVAE）的深度学习框架，用于增强训练数据以提高泛癌基因表达分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泛癌分类在肿瘤分型和治疗选择中具有重要作用，但由于数据高维度和样本量有限，分类具有挑战性。

Method: 通过特征选择减少基因表达特征数量，使用cVAE生成合成样本以增强训练数据，最后用多层感知机（MLP）进行分类。

Result: 增强后的框架在测试集上实现了约98%的高分类准确率，显著优于仅使用原始数据的分类器。

Conclusion: cVAE生成的合成数据可显著提高泛癌预测性能，尤其对样本较少的癌症类别效果显著。

Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform
tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high
dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)
to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using
801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression
features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on
this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on
cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for
each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples
(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A
two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the
augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high
classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially
outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present
detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier
performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture
diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based
synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction
performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

### [2] [A nonstandard finite difference scheme for an SEIQR epidemiological PDE mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02928)
*Achraf Zinihi,Matthias Ehrhardt,Moulay Rchid Sidi Ammi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非标准有限差分（NSFD）方法，用于反应-扩散SEIQR流行病学模型，捕捉传染病传播的时空动态。该方法保留了模型的定性特征，并通过数值模拟验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分方法在处理反应-扩散流行病模型时，常无法保持模型的定性特征（如正性、有界性和稳定性），因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用非标准有限差分（NSFD）方法对半线性抛物型偏微分方程系统进行离散化，确保模型的定性特征得以保留。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟表明，NSFD方法能够有效保持模型的生物学一致性动态。

Conclusion: NSFD方法为反应-扩散流行病模型提供了一种可靠且高效的数值解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a
reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the
spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a
system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model
extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to
account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD
discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential
qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are
often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze
the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for
the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical
simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's
effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of
Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture,
hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental
pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which
defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated
organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there
exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice
using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the
communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding
of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome
communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome
communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a
multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is
conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological
signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart
agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of
agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed.
These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things
enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and
eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges,
open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are
discussed.

TL;DR: 使用无人机和热成像技术估算奥地利东南部野生动物密度，并与相机陷阱数据对比，结果显示无人机方法高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物密度估算方法（如捕获-再捕获、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机提供了一种非侵入性、高效的替代方案。

Method: 在无叶期（10月和11月）使用无人机进行航测，结合热成像和RGB图像手动标注动物，并采用三种外推方法估算密度。

Result: 无人机方法与相机陷阱（REM）结果相似，但通常显示更高密度，可能反映白天活动与长期平均活动的差异。

Conclusion: 无人机为野生动物密度估算提供了高效、可扩展的新方法，但需结合传统方法以全面理解动物活动。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.
