In this study, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)\nto augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using\n801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression\nfeatures to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on\nthis data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on\ncancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for\neach tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples\n(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A\ntwo-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the\naugmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high\nclassification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially\noutperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present\ndetailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier\nperformance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture\ndiagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based\nsynthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction\nperformance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08cVAE\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u764c\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cdb\u764c\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u578b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528cVAE\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea698%\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "cVAE\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u764c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u522b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}
