Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential
to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep
learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify
images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures
is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some
picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being
utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The
suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how
picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study
specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more
complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when
image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may
learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are
incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend
the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification
accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct
extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.
This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms
customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the
trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流行病学模型中，部分状态变量和参数难以直接测量，传统方法在数据不完整时效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 利用PINN框架，结合代数可观测性分析，补充未测量数据，并通过数值实验验证方法的有效性。

Result: 在噪声和不完整数据下，所提方法对未测量状态和参数的估计精度高于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在流行病学建模中具有实际应用价值，尤其在数据不完整时表现优越。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a deep learning framework that
integrates the governing equations underlying data into a loss function. In
this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and
parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential
equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to
the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate
the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial
measurements is challenging.
  Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state
variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on
algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is
demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context
of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial
measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the
proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods.
The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such
as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed
from the measurements.

### [3] [SCOUT: An in-vivo Methane Sensing System for Real-time Monitoring of Enteric Emissions in Cattle with ex-vivo Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04056)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOUT是一种新型的体内甲烷监测系统，通过闭环气体循环设计实现高分辨率连续监测，显著优于传统环境采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有环境采样方法在数据保留率、环境干扰和时间分辨率上的不足，以推动畜牧业的可持续发展。

Method: 开发SCOUT系统，通过闭环气体循环设计进行连续监测，并与传统环境采样系统进行交叉验证。

Result: SCOUT数据保留率达82%，甲烷浓度检测能力比传统方法高100-1000倍，揭示了行为与排放的新关联。

Conclusion: SCOUT系统为基因组选择和精准畜牧管理提供了准确、连续的排放表型分析工具，推动了可持续畜牧业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate measurement of enteric methane emissions remains a critical
bottleneck for advancing livestock sustainability through genetic selection and
precision management. Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data
retention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.
We developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the
first robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution
monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop
gas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two
cannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with
cross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT
achieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for
conventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x
higher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong
scale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564
$\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical
significance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission
coupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\pm$ 11.3k ppm)
triggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously
inaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a
transformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping
essential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock
management. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for
agricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological
insights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for
sustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems.

### [4] [Continual Multiple Instance Learning for Hematologic Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04368)
*Zahra Ebrahimi,Raheleh Salehi,Nassir Navab,Carsten Marr,Ario Sadafi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多实例学习（MIL）的持续学习方法，通过选择实例并存储示例集来避免灾难性遗忘，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室和临床环境中的数据流需要持续更新模型以保持性能，但现有持续学习方法在多实例学习中效果不佳。

Method: 基于实例注意力分数和距离选择样本存储示例集，保留数据多样性。

Result: 在白血病实验室的真实数据中，该方法显著优于现有持续学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了多实例学习的持续学习，适应数据分布变化。

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.
