Abstract: microRNA are pivotal post-transcriptional regulators whose single-cell
behavior has remained largely inaccessible owing to technical barriers in
single-cell small-RNA profiling. We present SiCmiR, a two-layer neural network
that predicts miRNA expression profile from only 977 LINCS L1000 landmark genes
reducing sensitivity to dropout of single-cell RNA-seq data. Proof-of-concept
analyses illustrate how SiCmiR can uncover candidate hub-miRNAs in bulk-seq
cell lines and hepatocellular carcinoma, scRNA-seq pancreatic ductal carcinoma
and ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma and extracellular-vesicle-mediated
crosstalk in glioblastoma. Trained on 6462 TCGA paired miRNA-mRNA samples,
SiCmiR attains state-of-the-art accuracy on held-out cancers and generalizes to
unseen cancer types, drug perturbations and scRNA-seq. We next constructed
SiCmiR-Atlas, containing 632 public datasets, 9.36 million cells, 726 cell
types, which is the first dedicated database of single-cell mature miRNA
expression--providing interactive visualization, biomarker identification and
cell-type-resolved miRNA-target networks. SiCmiR transforms bulk-derived
statistical power into a single-cell view of miRNA biology and provides a
community resource SiCmiR Atlas for biomarker discovery. SiCmiR Atlas is
avilable at https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/~SiCmiR/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在模拟1型糖尿病患者的葡萄糖动态时，常忽略关键生理因素且难以个性化。本文旨在开发一种更准确且可个性化的模拟方法。

Method: 结合神经网络与常微分方程构建群体级模型，并通过个体数据增强生成数字孪生，最后用真实数据验证。

Result: 模拟与真实数据在葡萄糖动态上表现高度一致（如时间在范围内75.1% vs 74.4%）。

Conclusion: 该方法支持个性化治疗测试和胰岛素优化，结合了物理与数据驱动建模的优势。

Abstract: Simulating glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is
critical for developing personalized treatments and supporting data-driven
clinical decisions. Existing models often miss key physiological aspects and
are difficult to individualize. Here, we introduce physiologically-constrained
neural network (NN) digital twins to simulate glucose dynamics in T1D. To
ensure interpretability and physiological consistency, we first build a
population-level NN state-space model aligned with a set of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) describing glucose regulation. This model is
formally verified to conform to known T1D dynamics. Digital twins are then
created by augmenting the population model with individual-specific models,
which include personal data, such as glucose management and contextual
information, capturing both inter- and intra-individual variability. We
validate our approach using real-world data from the T1D Exercise Initiative
study. Two weeks of data per participant were split into 5-hour sequences and
simulated glucose profiles were compared to observed ones. Clinically relevant
outcomes were used to assess similarity via paired equivalence t-tests with
predefined clinical equivalence margins. Across 394 digital twins, glucose
outcomes were equivalent between simulated and observed data: time in range
(70-180 mg/dL) was 75.1$\pm$21.2% (simulated) vs. 74.4$\pm$15.4% (real;
P<0.001); time below range (<70 mg/dL) 2.5$\pm$5.2% vs. 3.0$\pm$3.3% (P=0.022);
and time above range (>180 mg/dL) 22.4$\pm$22.0% vs. 22.6$\pm$15.9% (P<0.001).
Our framework can incorporate unmodeled factors like sleep and activity while
preserving key dynamics. This approach enables personalized in silico testing
of treatments, supports insulin optimization, and integrates physics-based and
data-driven modeling. Code: https://github.com/mosqueralopez/T1DSim_AI

Abstract: For over two decades, image-based profiling has revolutionized cellular
phenotype analysis. Image-based profiling processes rich, high-throughput,
microscopy data into unbiased measurements that reveal phenotypic patterns
powerful for drug discovery, functional genomics, and cell state
classification. Here, we review the evolving computational landscape of
image-based profiling, detailing current procedures, discussing limitations,
and highlighting future development directions. Deep learning has fundamentally
reshaped image-based profiling, improving feature extraction, scalability, and
multimodal data integration. Methodological advancements such as single-cell
analysis and batch effect correction, drawing inspiration from single-cell
transcriptomics, have enhanced analytical precision. The growth of open-source
software ecosystems and the development of community-driven standards have
further democratized access to image-based profiling, fostering reproducibility
and collaboration across research groups. Despite these advancements, the field
still faces significant challenges requiring innovative solutions. By focusing
on the technical evolution of image-based profiling rather than the
wide-ranging biological applications, our aim with this review is to provide
researchers with a roadmap for navigating the progress and new challenges in
this rapidly advancing domain.
