Existing models often miss key physiological aspects and\nare difficult to individualize. Here, we introduce physiologically-constrained\nneural network (NN) digital twins to simulate glucose dynamics in T1D. To\nensure interpretability and physiological consistency, we first build a\npopulation-level NN state-space model aligned with a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) describing glucose regulation. This model is\nformally verified to conform to known T1D dynamics. Digital twins are then\ncreated by augmenting the population model with individual-specific models,\nwhich include personal data, such as glucose management and contextual\ninformation, capturing both inter- and intra-individual variability. We\nvalidate our approach using real-world data from the T1D Exercise Initiative\nstudy. Two weeks of data per participant were split into 5-hour sequences and\nsimulated glucose profiles were compared to observed ones. Clinically relevant\noutcomes were used to assess similarity via paired equivalence t-tests with\npredefined clinical equivalence margins. Across 394 digital twins, glucose\noutcomes were equivalent between simulated and observed data: time in range\n(70-180 mg/dL) was 75.1$\\pm$21.2% (simulated) vs. 74.4$\\pm$15.4% (real;\nP<0.001); time below range (<70 mg/dL) 2.5$\\pm$5.2% vs. 3.0$\\pm$3.3% (P=0.022);\nand time above range (>180 mg/dL) 22.4$\\pm$22.0% vs. 22.6$\\pm$15.9% (P<0.001).\nOur framework can incorporate unmodeled factors like sleep and activity while\npreserving key dynamics. This approach enables personalized in silico testing\nof treatments, supports insulin optimization, and integrates physics-based and\ndata-driven modeling.
