### [2] [CROP: Integrating Topological and Spatial Structures via Cross-View Prefixes for Molecular LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06917)
*Jianting Tang,Yubo Wang,Haoyu Cao,Linli Xu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: CROP方法通过多视角整合提升大语言模型对分子结构的理解，具有高效性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型仅依赖分子序列，无法捕捉复杂分子结构，需结合拓扑和空间视角。

Method: 提出CROP框架，包括SMILES引导的重采样器和结构嵌入门，整合分子序列、拓扑和空间视图。

Result: 实验证明CROP在分子描述、IUPAC命名和性质预测任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: CROP通过多视角整合显著提升分子科学任务的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular science have been propelled significantly by
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is limited when
relying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex
structures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two
complementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological
relationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second
emphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image
view. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures.
To leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes
(CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view
integration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly
resampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids
excessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy
expansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's
self-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the
quality of the generated prefixes. Specifically, our framework features a
carefully designed SMILES Guided Resampler for view resampling, and a
Structural Embedding Gate for converting the resulting embeddings into LLM's
prefixes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CROP in tasks
including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction and molecule property
prediction.

### [3] [How Effectively Can Large Language Models Connect SNP Variants and ECG Phenotypes for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07127)
*Niranjana Arun Menon,Iqra Farooq,Yulong Li,Sara Ahmed,Yutong Xie,Muhammad Awais,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用微调的大型语言模型（LLMs）预测心血管疾病（CVD）及其相关遗传标记的潜力，通过分析高维基因组数据，展示了LLMs在早期检测和个性化医疗中的应用前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病的预测因其多因素病因和高发病率而具有挑战性，现有基因组数据的高维性和噪声问题增加了分析的难度。

Method: 研究采用微调的LLMs，通过Chain of Thought（CoT）推理任务，从结构化和半结构化基因组数据中学习潜在生物学关系，预测疾病标签和临床推论。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs能够有效识别与心脏疾病相关的遗传模式，并生成准确的临床推断，为早期检测和风险评估提供了新方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在心血管疾病预测和个性化医疗中展现出巨大潜力，有望推动心脏护理的进步。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to
its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality.
Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data,
extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy,
and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has
been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological
sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict
cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers
derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of
genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can
learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured
genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the
family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task,
the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed
clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The
findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk
assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac
care.

### [4] [MOTGNN: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Omics Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07465)
*Tiantian Yang,Zhiqian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOTGNN是一种新型的多组学数据整合框架，通过XGBoost和GNN实现疾病分类，显著提升预测性能并保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学数据整合能全面揭示疾病机制，但高维度和复杂交互为建模带来挑战。

Method: 使用XGBoost构建组学特异性图，结合GNN进行分层表示学习，最后通过深度前馈网络整合跨组学数据。

Result: 在三个真实疾病数据集上，MOTGNN在准确性、ROC-AUC和F1分数上优于基线5-10%，且对类别不平衡鲁棒。

Conclusion: MOTGNN在多组学疾病建模中显著提升预测准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and
microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological
mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex
interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive
modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural
Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease
classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform
omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a
deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world
disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in
accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance
(e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains
computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and
provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and
the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight
MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in
multi-omics disease modeling.

### [5] [GFlowNets for Learning Better Drug-Drug Interaction Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06576)
*Azmine Toushik Wasi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GFlowNet和VGAE的框架，用于生成稀有药物相互作用样本，解决数据不平衡问题，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物相互作用数据集中存在严重的类别不平衡问题，常见相互作用占主导，稀有但关键的相互作用样本不足，导致模型性能不佳。

Method: 结合生成流网络（GFlowNet）和变分图自编码器（VGAE），生成稀有类别的合成样本，改善数据平衡。

Result: 提出的框架显著提升了模型对各类药物相互作用的预测性能，增强了临床可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过生成稀有类别的合成样本，有效解决了数据不平衡问题，提升了药物相互作用预测的整体性能。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology,
with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness
of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but
critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model
performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as
a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward
frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)
to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and
generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive
performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

### [6] [Fractal Language Modelling by Universal Sequence Maps (USM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06641)
*Jonas S Almeida,Daniel E Russ,Susana Vinga,Ines Duarte,Lee Mason,Praphulla Bhawsar,Aaron Ge,Arlindo Oliveira,Jeya Balaji Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的通用序列映射（USM）方法，解决了迭代过程中的种子偏差问题，实现了序列身份与数值定位的完全一致，并揭示了USM作为高效数值过程的本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的语言模型（如ChatGPT）的兴起，研究者对多尺度和多维度的符号序列数值表示方法重新产生兴趣。编码的挑战在于需要保留符号序列的上下文信息，以便通过非线性模型（如神经网络）进行建模。

Method: USM是一种双射迭代函数，通过正向和反向的混沌游戏表示（CGR）将符号序列编码到数值空间中，并投影到频域（FCGR）。USM坐标可用于计算切比雪夫距离和k-mer频率，且支持非整数值k。

Result: 改进的USM方法解决了种子偏差问题，实现了序列身份与数值定位的完全一致，并揭示了USM作为高效数值过程的收敛特性。实验以基因组序列为例，展示了其普适性。

Conclusion: USM是一种高效的数值编码方法，适用于任意基数的字母表，为序列分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers,
popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding
procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and
embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for
mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of
individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as
neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively
encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of
two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that
can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM
coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer
frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,
paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal
Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.
The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing
outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;
and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging
towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results
for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation
defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless,
the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be
straightforward.

### [7] [A Stage-Aware Mixture of Experts Framework for Neurodegenerative Disease Progression Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07032)
*Tiantian He,Keyue Jiang,An Zhao,Anna Schroder,Elinor Thompson,Sonja Soskic,Frederik Barkhof,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型阶段感知的Mixture of Experts (MoE)框架，结合图神经网络扩散模型和局部神经反应模块，动态建模神经退行性疾病的进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经退行性疾病进展建模的挑战，包括纵向数据稀缺和病理机制复杂交互的问题。

Method: 采用阶段感知MoE框架，结合时间依赖的专家权重、迭代双优化方法和非均匀图神经扩散模型（IGND）。

Result: 模型动态整合时空组件，揭示了不同疾病阶段病理机制的贡献，与文献一致。

Conclusion: IGND-MoE模型为理解神经退行性疾病的阶段特异性机制提供了新方法。

Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly
conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph
diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized
reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression
remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained
through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of
pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where
traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms
dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert
weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to
properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,
constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.
Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural
diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and
time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also
introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond
standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these
components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how
stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The
stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,
suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,
while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.

### [8] [Modelling phenology using ordered categorical generalized additive models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07789)
*David L Miller*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种灵活的方法，使用R包`mgcv`对有序分类数据建模，避免因简化数据自然结构导致的错误推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态学中的物候数据常被简化为连续分布或概率模型，这可能忽略数据的自然结构，导致错误推断。

Method: 使用R包`mgcv`对有序分类数据进行建模，并通过实例分析验证。

Result: 论文展示了包括有用图表、模型检验和导出量的格陵兰虎耳草物候分析。

Conclusion: 通过灵活建模方法，论文解决了物候数据分析中的潜在问题，并提供了实用工具。

Abstract: One form of data collected in ecology is phenological, describing the timing
of life stages. It can be tempting to analyze such data using a continuous
distribution or to model individual transitions via probit/logit models. Such
simplifications can lead to incorrect inference in various ways, all of which
stem from ignoring the natural structure of the data. This paper presents a
flexible approach to modelling ordered categorical data using the popular R
package `mgcv`. An example analysis of saxifrage phenology in Greenland
including useful plots, model checking and derived quantities is included.

### [9] [Adding structure to generalized additive models, with applications in ecology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07915)
*David L Miller,Ken Newman,Thomas Cornulier*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种广义加性模型（GAMs）的扩展方法，用于高效处理向量值协变量，避免传统标量化方法的信息丢失或结构忽视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态学等领域中，协变量常为向量值（如时间序列或空间数据），传统标量化方法可能导致信息丢失或结构忽视，亟需更有效的建模方法。

Method: 引入三种扩展模型：变系数模型、标量对函数模型和分布滞后模型，并通过R包mgcv实现。

Result: 这些模型能够更高效地处理向量值协变量，避免传统方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 三种扩展模型为生态学等领域提供了更灵活的建模工具，适合处理复杂协变量结构。

Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) that connect a set of scalar covariates
that map 1-1 to a response variable are commonly employed in ecological and
other scientific disciplines. However, covariates are often inherently
non-scalar, taking on multiple values for each observation of the response.
They can sometimes have a temporal structure, e.g., a time series of
temperature and precipitation measurements, or a spatial structure, e.g.,
multiple soil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or
selectively summarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the
use of standard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be
problematic, e.g., using a mean or median value for some subsequence of a time
series, and information is necessarily lost as well. On the other hand naively
including all $p$ components of a vector-valued covariate as $p$ separate
covariates, say, without recognizing the structure, can lead to problems of
multicollinearity, data sets that are excessively wide given the sample size,
and difficulty extracting the primary signal provided by the covariate. In this
paper we introduce three useful extensions to GAMs that provide means of
efficiently and effectively handling vector-valued covariates without requiring
one to choose problematic aggregations or selective summarizations. These
extensions are varying-coefficient, scalar-on-function and distributed lag
models. While these models have existed for some time they remain relatively
underused in ecology. This article aims to show when these models can be useful
and how to fit them with the popular R package \texttt{mgcv}.

### [10] [RNA-KG v2.0: An RNA-centered Knowledge Graph with Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07427)
*Emanuele Cavalleri,Paolo Perlasca,Marco Mesiti*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: RNA-KG v2.0是一个整合了约1亿条手动整理交互的知识图谱，支持RNA分子分类、链接预测和隐藏模式发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合更多数据源和标准化属性，以支持更高级的查询和上下文感知应用。

Method: 从91个开放数据源和本体中整合数据，标准化交互属性，并丰富节点信息。

Result: 构建了一个包含详细上下文信息和丰富节点属性的知识图谱。

Conclusion: RNA-KG v2.0为RNA研究提供了更强大的工具，支持上下文感知的链接预测和其他应用。

Abstract: RNA-KG is a recently developed knowledge graph that integrates the
interactions involving coding and non-coding RNA molecules extracted from
public data sources. It can be used to support the classification of new
molecules, identify new interactions through the use of link prediction
methods, and reveal hidden patterns among the represented entities. In this
paper, we propose RNA-KG v2.0, a new release of RNA-KG that integrates around
100M manually curated interactions sourced from 91 linked open data
repositories and ontologies. Relationships are characterized by standardized
properties that capture the specific context (e.g., cell line, tissue,
pathological state) in which they have been identified. In addition, the nodes
are enriched with detailed attributes, such as descriptions, synonyms, and
molecular sequences sourced from platforms such as OBO ontologies, NCBI
repositories, RNAcentral, and Ensembl. The enhanced repository enables the
expression of advanced queries that take into account the context in which the
experiments were conducted. It also supports downstream applications in RNA
research, including "context-aware" link prediction techniques that combine
both topological and semantic information.

*Maria Alejandra Valdez Cabrera,Amy D Willis*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: Towering space扩展了BHV空间，支持不同叶子集的系统发育树比较，解决了BHV空间的主要限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BHV空间无法比较叶子集不同的系统发育树，限制了其在实际数据集中的应用。

Method: 引入Towering空间，通过修剪和嫁接操作连接多个BHV空间，并研究其几何路径和距离计算算法。

Result: Towering空间为多域基因树等现代系统发育数据集提供了有效的分析工具。

Conclusion: Towering空间解决了BHV空间的局限性，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Phylogenetic trees summarize evolutionary relationships. The
Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space for comparing phylogenetic trees has many
elegant mathematical properties, but it does not encompass trees with differing
leaf sets. To overcome this, we introduce Towering space: a complete metric
space that extends BHV space to trees with non-identical leaf sets. Towering
space is a structured collection of BHV spaces connected via pruning and
regrafting operations. We study the geometry of paths in Towering space and
present an algorithm for computing metric distances. By addressing a major
limitation of BHV space, Towering space facilitates the analysis of modern
phylogenetic datasets such as multi-domain gene trees.

*Orion Li,Vinayak Agarwal,Summer Zhou,Ashwin Gopinath,Timothy Kassis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: K-Dense Analyst是一个分层多代理系统，通过双循环架构实现自主生物信息学分析，性能超越GPT-5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生物信息学分析的复杂性导致数据生成与科学洞察之间存在巨大差距，现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在迭代计算、工具集成和严格验证方面存在局限。

Method: K-Dense Analyst采用分层多代理系统和双循环架构，将复杂目标分解为可执行、可验证的任务，并在安全计算环境中执行。

Result: 在BixBench基准测试中，K-Dense Analyst的准确率达到29.2%，比GPT-5高出6.3个百分点，性能提升近27%。

Conclusion: 自主科学推理需要专门构建的系统，而不仅仅是增强的语言模型。K-Dense Analyst为完全自主的计算生物学家提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap
between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain
fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that
demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We
introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves
autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense
Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated
execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into
executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On
BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense
Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model
(GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what
is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense
Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only
18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural
innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline
performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning
requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems
that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level
computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward
fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery
across the life sciences.
