The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR).

However, covariates are often inherently\nnon-scalar, taking on multiple values for each observation of the response.\nThey can sometimes have a temporal structure, e.g., a time series of\ntemperature and precipitation measurements, or a spatial structure, e.g.,\nmultiple soil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or\nselectively summarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the\nuse of standard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be\nproblematic, e.g., using a mean or median value for some subsequence of a time\nseries, and information is necessarily lost as well. On the other hand naively\nincluding all $p$ components of a vector-valued covariate as $p$ separate\ncovariates, say, without recognizing the structure, can lead to problems of\nmulticollinearity, data sets that are excessively wide given the sample size,\nand difficulty extracting the primary signal provided by the covariate.
