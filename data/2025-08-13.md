*Nadezhda Diadkina*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一个交互式网络工具，整合了描述性DDI记录和基于AUC的DDI数据，支持临床药理学研究和教育。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公共数据库中药物相互作用（DDI）信息缺乏药代动力学背景的问题。

Method: 整合DrugBank和PK-DDIP数据集，通过自然语言处理和手动验证提取数据，并使用多步骤名称统一方法。

Result: 统一了1,803个相互作用对，涵盖639种化合物，开发了一个基于Streamlit的交互平台。

Conclusion: 该工具为临床药理学和药物安全研究提供了支持，但不适用于临床决策。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major concern in polypharmacy. Public
databases often provide only qualitative descriptions without pharmacokinetic
context. We present an interactive web tool that integrates 191,541 descriptive
DDI records from DrugBank with 3,779 AUC-based interactions from the PK-DDIP
dataset, extracted from FDA-approved drug labeling (DailyMed) using natural
language processing and manual verification. Using multi-step name
harmonization (exact, fuzzy, synonym expansion, manual curation), 1,803
interaction pairs were unified across 639 overlapping compounds. The platform
is built with Streamlit and offers smart drug search, color-coded output, and
real-time response. It enables users to explore both descriptive and
pharmacokinetic data, supporting research and education in clinical
pharmacology and drug safety. This research prototype is not intended for
clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: SpectraLLM是一种新型大型语言模型，用于多模态光谱联合推理，能够高效解析未知分子结构，显著优于现有单模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构解析方法依赖先验数据库或专家知识，成本高且难以处理未知结构。

Result: 在六个标准化化学数据集上表现优异，单谱推理和多模态推理均显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: SpectraLLM为结构解析提供了高效、鲁棒的新方法，尤其在多模态场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the
microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various
disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods
often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making
it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures
typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This
process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by
high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these
challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to
support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of
processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing
end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete
spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to
uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across
spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and
fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six
standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches
trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong
robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its
multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural
prediction.

### [3] [A control theoretical approach to gene regulation raises quantitative constraints for dynamic homeostasis in stochastic gene expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09038)

TL;DR: 论文研究了细胞内主调控基因（MRG）的反馈控制如何维持动态稳态，尽管存在随机性。通过随机模型和模拟算法，揭示了MRG表达轨迹的可调性、最优反馈控制的存在性以及非线性动态关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞内反应的随机性与细胞表型动态稳态之间的矛盾，促使研究MRG反馈控制的定量约束和机制。

Method: 将MRG表达建模为随机过程，下游基因作为条件传感器，结合随机模型解析解和SSA模拟算法。

Result: 发现MRG表达轨迹可调、存在最优反馈控制采样率、动态关系非线性，且MRG启动子ON状态概率动态受限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了动态稳态的定量约束和非最优稳态机制，为基因网络调控治疗提供理论原型。

Abstract: Cell phenotype dynamic homeostasis contrasts with the inherent randomness of
intracellular reactions. Although feedback control of master regulatory genes
(MRG) is a key strategy for maintaining gene network expression ranges limited,
understanding the quantitative constraints and corresponding mechanisms
enabling such a dynamic stability under noise remains elusive. Here we model
MRG expression as a stochastic process and downstream genes as sensors which
response conditionally induce MRG activity. We show that at homeostatic regime:
i. the trajectories of the MRG expression levels can be adjusted towards
specific ranges using both the exact solutions of the stochastic model and the
exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA); ii. there exists a sampling rate
which optimizes the feedback control of the MRG activity, and non-optimal
controls resulting in alternative homeostatic dynamics; iii. the feedback
control of MRG activity leads to updates which intensities and time intervals
are non-linearly related; iv. the ON state probability of an MRG promoter has
dynamics confined within a narrow domain. Our results help to understand the
quantitative constraints underpinning dynamic homeostasis despite randomness,
the mechanisms underlying alternative, non-optimal, homeostatic regimes, and
may be useful for theoretically prototyping therapies aiming at gene networks
modulation.

### [4] [Quantifying the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 vaccination: evidence from Victoria, Australia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08763)
*Lixin Lin,Haydar Demirhan,Peter Eizenberg,James M. Trauer,Lewi Stone*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，用于量化疫苗接种的间接群体免疫效果，并应用于澳大利亚维多利亚州的Delta疫情，结果显示疫苗接种显著减少了感染、住院和死亡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来，研究人员难以量化疫苗接种在群体层面的间接效果，这阻碍了对疫苗接种项目有效性的评估。

Method: 开发了一种新方法，通过建模非疫苗接种的反事实情景，估计疫苗接种的间接效果。

Result: 在Delta疫情期间，疫苗接种间接避免了316,000例感染、33,500例住院和4,900例死亡，其中一半感染和四分之一住院及死亡归因于间接保护。

Conclusion: 疫苗接种的间接效果显著，且均匀接种可进一步减少25%的不良结果。

Abstract: Vaccines not only directly protect vaccinated individuals but also contribute
to protect the entire population via indirect herd-immunity benefits. However,
researchers have long struggled to quantify these indirect effects at the
population level, hindering assessment of vaccination program effectiveness. We
developed a new method to estimate these effects, thereby markedly improving
measures of the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by
vaccination. Our population-based analysis of 6,440,000 residents of Victoria,
Australia reveal strong indirect effects during the Delta outbreak
(September-November 2021). By modelling a non-vaccination counterfactual, we
conservatively estimate 316,000 infections were averted (95\% BCI: 232k-406k),
as well as 33,500 hospitalizations (95\% BCI: 22.2k-46.2k), and 4,900 deaths
(95\% BCI: 2.9k-7.3k). These are 4.0, 7.5, and 8.0 times higher, respectively,
than observed. Half of the averted infections and around one-quarter of
hospitalizations and deaths were attributable to indirect protection.
Homogeneous vaccination across LGAs could have reduced outcomes by
approximately 25\%.

TL;DR: HSA-Net框架通过分层自适应投影器和源感知融合模块，解决了GNN中深层特征的过平滑问题，并在分子表示学习中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在深层网络中面临过平滑问题，现有方法无法有效处理深层和浅层特征的全局-局部权衡。

Method: 提出HSA-Net框架，包含分层自适应投影器（HAP）和源感知融合（SAF）模块，分别处理不同层次的特征并动态融合。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层和结构感知设计，有效解决了分子表示学习中的全局-局部权衡问题。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
