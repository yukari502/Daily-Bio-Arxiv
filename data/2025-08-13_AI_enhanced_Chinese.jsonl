Here we model\nMRG expression as a stochastic process and downstream genes as sensors which\nresponse conditionally induce MRG activity. We show that at homeostatic regime:\ni. the trajectories of the MRG expression levels can be adjusted towards\nspecific ranges using both the exact solutions of the stochastic model and the\nexact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA); ii. there exists a sampling rate\nwhich optimizes the feedback control of the MRG activity, and non-optimal\ncontrols resulting in alternative homeostatic dynamics; iii. the feedback\ncontrol of MRG activity leads to updates which intensities and time intervals\nare non-linearly related; iv. the ON state probability of an MRG promoter has\ndynamics confined within a narrow domain. Our results help to understand the\nquantitative constraints underpinning dynamic homeostasis despite randomness,\nthe mechanisms underlying alternative, non-optimal, homeostatic regimes, and\nmay be useful for theoretically prototyping therapies aiming at gene networks\nmodulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u5185\u4e3b\u8c03\u63a7\u57fa\u56e0\uff08MRG\uff09\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u7ef4\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MRG\u8868\u8fbe\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u6027\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u80de\u5185\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec6\u80de\u8868\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76MRG\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MRG\u8868\u8fbe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u57fa\u56e0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u548cSSA\u6a21\u62df\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0MRG\u8868\u8fbe\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u8c03\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u4e14MRG\u542f\u52a8\u5b50ON\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u56e0\u7f51\u7edc\u8c03\u63a7\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u539f\u578b\u3002"}}
