This requires the redevelopment of the\nmodel when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and\neffort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical\nusage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the\nabove gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding\nmodel for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a\ntempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature\nselec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms\nand generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature\nextraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are\nextracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to\nform high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The\nresults, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI,\nSSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%,\n80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and\nmacro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models.\nThis study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm\nclassifica-tion.

Unlike standard approaches that assume\nsigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions\n(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses\nGaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model\nany melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through\nkernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing\nproteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,\nsuch as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,\nwhere conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to\ntheir statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing\nproteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating\nproteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal\nthermal stability behaviors.
