### [1] [A Structural Analysis of Population Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10058)
*Kimberly Ayers,Maxwell Kooiker*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于基因组数据构建群体图的方法，验证了GENPOFAD距离度量作为度量函数的性质，并提出了一种可视化群体关系的算法，最后通过统计分析证明了模拟群体图与随机图和小世界图的区别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组数据的图形化算法格式在生物技术领域存在争议，本文旨在通过构建群体图来可视化个体间关系。

Method: 首先验证GENPOFAD距离度量的度量函数性质，随后开发算法构建群体图，并进行统计分析。

Result: 模拟群体图与随机图和小世界图具有显著差异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效可视化基因组数据中的群体关系，并区分于其他图类型。

Abstract: The format of graphing algorithms for genomic data has been a debate in
recent biotechnology. In this paper, we discuss the construction of population
graphs using said genomic data. We first examine the GENPOFAD distance
measurement, developed by Joly et. al., and prove that this constitutes a
metric function. We develop an algorithm to construct graphs to visualize the
relationships between individuals in a population. We then provide a
statistical analysis of these simulated population graphs, and show that they
are distinct from randomly generated graphs, and also show differences from
small-world graphs.

### [2] [Developing an Inhaled NEU1 Inhibitor for Cystic Fibrosis via Pharmacokinetic and Biophysical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10082)
*Yousra Hassan Alsaad Almeshale,Abdulelah Hassan Almeshali,Omar Alsaddique,Noura Jandali,Nadeen Garaween,Bin Hu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种综合药代动力学/药效学模型，评估吸入NEU1抑制剂对囊性纤维化（CF）的疗效，预测其可显著降低黏液粘度并改善肺功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CF气道黏液因唾液酸化减少导致粘度增加，影响黏液纤毛清除（MCC）。NEU1抑制剂可能恢复MCC，但其吸入给药的定量药代动力学和流变学效果尚未明确。

Method: 结合实验与临床前数据，通过吸入PK/PD建模和生物物理粘度框架，模拟合成队列（N=200），并采用拉丁超立方参数采样验证模型。

Result: 模型预测NEU1抑制剂可显著降低黏液粘度（25-28%），并改善肺功能（FEV1增加0.13升），约70%效果通过MCC介导。

Conclusion: 吸入NEU1抑制剂在CF中具有临床可行性，需进一步体内验证。

Abstract: Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway mucus exhibits reduced mucin
sialylation, increasing viscosity and impairing mucociliary clearance (MCC).
NEU1 inhibition has been proposed to restore MCC, but its quantitative
pharmacokinetic and rheological effects, particularly with inhaled delivery,
remain uncharacterized.
  Objective: To develop an integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)
and biophysical model to assess the efficacy of an inhaled NEU1 inhibitor.
  Methods: Empirical and preclinical NEU1 inhibition data were combined with
inhalation PK/PD modeling and a biophysical viscosity framework linking mucin
sialylation and extracellular DNA. Synthetic cohort simulations (N = 200) were
reconciled with empirical PK benchmarks using Latin hypercube parameter
sampling. Cross-validation, hold-out testing, and causal inference methods
(inverse probability of treatment weighting and targeted maximum likelihood
estimation) quantified predicted effects on lung function (delta FEV1).
  Results: With reconciled parameters (F_dep = 0.12; k_abs = 0.21 per hour;
k_muc = 0.24 per hour), epithelial lining fluid drug levels reached a peak
concentration of 7.5 micromolar (95 percent CI: 6 to 10 micromolar), achieving
IC50 coverage for approximately 10 hours per day and greater than 80 percent
modeled NEU1 inhibition. Predicted mucus viscosity reduction averaged 25 to 28
percent. Causal inference estimated delta FEV1 improvement of +0.13 liters (95
percent CI: 0.10 to 0.15 liters), with about 70 percent mediated via MCC.
  Conclusions: Empirically anchored PK/PD and biophysical modeling support the
feasibility of inhaled NEU1 inhibition as a rheology-targeting strategy in CF,
projecting clinically realistic efficacy while maintaining pharmacological
viability. This calibrated proof of concept warrants in vivo validation in CF
models.

### [3] [Estimating carbon pools in the shelf sea environment: reanalysis or model-informed machine learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10178)
*Jozef Skakala*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 利用神经网络（NN）从物理-生物地球化学模型中学习可观测变量与碳库的关系，为欧洲西北大陆架（NWES）提供低成本且可解释的碳库预测及不确定性信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大陆架海域碳库数据稀疏或不确定性高的问题，提供比传统再分析更经济的替代方案。

Method: 使用神经网络集合从模型自由运行模拟中学习，并应用于NWES再分析数据。

Result: NN能准确再现再分析的碳库输出，并提供不确定性信息，适用于未来气候情景分析。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的机器学习是昂贵再分析的有效替代，可补充缺失或不确定的观测数据。

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but
available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea
environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided
by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an
ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled
physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable
variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)
sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is
applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis
outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN
ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We
focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs
for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine
learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could
complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly
uncertain.

### [4] [Scalable Modeling of Nonlinear Network Dynamics in Neurodegenerative Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10343)
*Daniel Semchin,Emile d'Angremont,Marco Lorenzi,Boris Gutman*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: COMIND模型结合扩散和逻辑模型与脑结构连接，优化神经退行性疾病的动态推断，提高可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型因个体疾病轨迹异质性和参数过多而难以扩展的问题。

Method: 结合扩散和逻辑模型与结构脑连接，保证疾病轨迹单调性并减少参数。

Result: 在模拟数据和PPMI数据上验证了模型的有效性，无需减少生物标志物数量。

Conclusion: COMIND模型为神经退行性疾病的临床研究和治疗提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Mechanistic models of progressive neurodegeneration offer great potential
utility for clinical use and novel treatment development. Toward this end,
several connectome-informed models of neuroimaging biomarkers have been
proposed. However, these models typically do not scale well beyond a small
number of biomarkers due to heterogeneity in individual disease trajectories
and a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce the
Connectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND).
The model combines concepts from diffusion and logistic models with structural
brain connectivity. This guarantees monotonic disease trajectories while
maintaining a limited number of parameters to improve scalability. We evaluate
our model on simulated data as well as on the Parkinson's Progressive Markers
Initiative (PPMI) data. Our model generalizes to anatomical imaging
representations from a standard brain atlas without the need to reduce
biomarker number.

### [5] [SimAQ: Mitigating Experimental Artifacts in Soft X-Ray Tomography using Simulated Acquisitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10821)
*Jacob Egebjerg,Daniel Wüstner*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟管道方法，生成逼真的细胞模型并添加合成伪影，用于训练神经网络，实现少量样本和零样本迁移学习，有效分割软X射线断层扫描图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软X射线断层扫描（SXT）存在实验伪影和标注数据不足的问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 开发模拟管道生成合成数据（含伪影的噪声体积、正弦图和重建图像），并训练神经网络进行分割。

Result: 模型在少量或零标注数据下实现了对真实SXT断层图像的有效分割。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖大量标注数据或复杂重建方法，即可实现噪声断层图像的定量分析。

Abstract: Soft X-ray tomography (SXT) provides detailed structural insight into whole
cells but is hindered by experimental artifacts such as the missing wedge and
by limited availability of annotated datasets. We present \method, a simulation
pipeline that generates realistic cellular phantoms and applies synthetic
artifacts to produce paired noisy volumes, sinograms, and reconstructions. We
validate our approach by training a neural network primarily on synthetic data
and demonstrate effective few-shot and zero-shot transfer learning on real SXT
tomograms. Our model delivers accurate segmentations, enabling quantitative
analysis of noisy tomograms without relying on large labeled datasets or
complex reconstruction methods.

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 论文探讨了传统药用植物Garcinia cowa中的黄酮类化合物及其抗癌潜力，通过网络药理学和机器学习方法揭示了其分子机制和潜在靶点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症是全球死亡率最高的复杂疾病，传统药用植物Garcinia cowa在东南亚被广泛用于治疗多种疾病，其黄酮类化合物显示出抗癌潜力。

Method: 采用网络药理学分析关键生物活性化合物及其靶点，并结合Graph Attention Network算法预测pIC50值，分子对接验证潜在靶点。

Result: 发现Rubraxanthone等化合物及其靶点（如TNF、MTOR），Graph Attention Network算法预测性能优异（R2=0.98，RMSE=0.02），分子对接证实MTOR为潜在靶点。

Conclusion: Garcinia cowa的黄酮类化合物具有抗癌潜力，网络药理学和机器学习方法为揭示其机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the
highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward
affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis
to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in
Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough,
indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone
compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological
activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents.
Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds
Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside
their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing
critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer
effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive
performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data
augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone
based compounds. Additionally, molecular docking revealed MTOR as a potential
target for inducing cytotoxicity in HeLa cancer cells from Garcinia cowa.

### [7] [HelixVS: Deep Learning Enhanced Structure-based Virtual Screening Platform for Hit Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10262)
*Shanzhuo Zhang,Xianbin Ye,Donglong He,Yueyang Huang,Xiaonan Zhang,Xiaomin Fang*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: HelixVS是一种基于深度学习的虚拟筛选平台，显著提高了筛选效率和准确性，适用于多种药物靶点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高虚拟筛选的成本效益，探索更大的化合物库同时降低筛选成本。

Method: HelixVS整合了深度学习姿势评分模型和多阶段虚拟筛选流程。

Result: 相比传统工具，HelixVS的富集因子提高了2.6倍，筛选速度快10倍以上，湿实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: HelixVS能高效识别高亲和力配体，并免费提供有限计算资源版本以加速药物发现。

Abstract: Drug discovery through virtual screening (VS) has become a popular strategy
for identifying hits against protein targets. VS has the potential to reduce
the cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments.
Improving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant
challenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower
screening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform
enhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep
learning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a
multi-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds.
Compared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated
significantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets,
achieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10
times faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development
pipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and
novel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these
pipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the
molecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels.
This demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for
various targets and pockets. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available and
free version of HelixVS with limited computing power to assist drug development
scientists in accelerating their drug discovery processes.
