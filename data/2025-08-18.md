Motivation: 脑肿瘤在撒哈拉以南非洲（SSA）因医疗资源有限导致诊断延迟，自动分割技术可提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用SwinUNETR-v2、nnUNet和MedNeXt模型，在BraTS-Africa 2024和BraTS2021数据集上训练，并在SSA验证集上评估。

Result: MedNeXt表现最佳，平均Dice分数为0.84，混合数据集训练未显著提升性能。

Abstract: Brain tumors are among the deadliest cancers worldwide, with particularly
devastating impact in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where limited access to medical
imaging infrastructure and expertise often delays diagnosis and treatment
planning. Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for treatment planning,
surgical guidance, and monitoring disease progression, yet manual segmentation
is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in
deep learning, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have demonstrated significant potential in automating this critical task. This
study evaluates three state-of-the-art architectures, SwinUNETR-v2, nnUNet, and
MedNeXt for automated brain tumor segmentation in multi-parametric Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. We trained our models on the BraTS-Africa 2024
and BraTS2021 datasets, and performed validation on the BraTS-Africa 2024
validation set. We observed that training on a mixed dataset (BraTS-Africa 2024
and BraTS2021) did not yield improved performance on the SSA validation set in
all tumor regions compared to training solely on SSA data with well-validated
methods. Ensembling predictions from different models also lead to notable
performance increases. Our best-performing model, a finetuned MedNeXt, achieved
an average lesion-wise Dice score of 0.84, with individual scores of 0.81
(enhancing tumor), 0.81 (tumor core), and 0.91 (whole tumor). While further
improvements are expected with extended training and larger datasets, these
results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying deep learning for reliable
tumor segmentation in resource-limited settings. We further highlight the need
to improve local data acquisition protocols to support the development of
clinically relevant, region-specific AI tools.

Abstract: Bioprocesses are central to modern biotechnology, enabling sustainable
production in pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, cosmetics, and food.
However, developing high-performing processes is costly and complex, requiring
iterative, multi-scale experimentation from microtiter plates to pilot
reactors. Conventional Design of Experiments (DoE) approaches often struggle to
address process scale-up and the joint optimization of reaction conditions and
biocatalyst selection.
  We propose a multi-fidelity batch Bayesian optimization framework to
accelerate bioprocess development and reduce experimental costs. The method
integrates Gaussian Processes tailored for multi-fidelity modeling and
mixed-variable optimization, guiding experiment selection across scales and
biocatalysts. A custom simulation of a Chinese Hamster Ovary bioprocess,
capturing non-linear and coupled scale-up dynamics, is used for benchmarking
against multiple simulated industrial DoE baselines. Multiple case studies show
how the proposed workflow can achieve a reduction in experimental costs and
increased yield.
  This work provides a data-efficient strategy for bioprocess optimization and
highlights future opportunities in transfer learning and uncertainty-aware
design for sustainable biotechnology.

Abstract: In microbiome studies, it is often of great interest to identify clusters or
partitions of microbiome profiles within a study population and to characterize
the distinctive attributes of each resulting microbial community. While raw
counts or relative compositions are commonly used for such analysis, variations
between clusters may be driven or distorted by subject-level covariates,
reflecting underlying biological and clinical heterogeneity across individuals.
Simultaneously detecting latent communities and identifying covariates that
differentiate them can enhance our understanding of the microbiome and its
association with health outcomes. To this end, we propose a
Dirichlet-multinomial mixture regression (DMMR) model that enables joint
clustering of microbiome profiles while accounting for covariates with either
homogeneous or heterogeneous effects across clusters. A novel symmetric link
function is introduced to facilitate covariate modeling through the
compositional parameters. We develop efficient algorithms with convergence
guarantees for parameter estimation and establish theoretical properties of the
proposed estimators. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness
of the method in clustering, feature selection, and heterogeneity detection. We
illustrate the utility of DMMR through a comprehensive application to
upper-airway microbiota data from a pediatric asthma study, uncovering distinct
microbial subtypes and their associations with clinical characteristics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合量子-经典架构QBM-VAE，利用量子处理器高效采样Boltzmann分布，解决了传统高斯先验在复杂生物数据中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概率深度学习依赖高斯先验，无法准确捕捉复杂非高斯数据（如生物数据），而Boltzmann分布虽更具表达力，但经典计算机难以处理。量子方法因规模和稳定性不足未能应用于深度学习。

Method: 提出QBM-VAE，结合量子处理器和经典深度学习，利用量子采样Boltzmann分布作为先验，构建生成模型。

Result: 在百万级单细胞数据集上，QBM-VAE优于传统高斯模型（如VAE、SCVI），在数据整合、细胞分类和轨迹推断等任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: QBM-VAE展示了量子优势在深度学习中的实际应用，为开发混合量子AI模型提供了可转移的蓝图。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant
reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from
accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,
particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely
hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The
physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive
alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To
date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and
operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.
Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann
Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable
hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum
processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its
use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to
million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates
a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,
consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models
like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type
classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of
introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire
scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This
work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep
learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable
blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

TL;DR: Applm利用xTrimoPGLM蛋白质语言模型，显著优于现有方法，用于识别过敏原蛋白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过敏原蛋白对公共健康构成挑战，需要更准确的识别方法。

Method: Applm基于1000亿参数的xTrimoPGLM模型，处理多样任务如新过敏原识别和同源蛋白区分。

Result: Applm在多种任务中表现优于七种现有方法，xTrimoPGLM模型是关键。

Conclusion: Applm开源并提供基准数据集，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 指出了未来研究方向，如分离真实动态与噪声、学习空间动态、优化训练与数值方法对齐等。

Abstract: This review maps developments in stochastic modeling, highlighting
non-standard approaches and their applications to biology and epidemiology. It
brings together four strands: (1) core models for systems that evolve with
randomness; (2) learning key parts of those models directly from data; (3)
methods that can generate realistic synthetic data in continuous time; and (4)
numerical techniques that keep simulations stable, accurate, and faithful over
long runs. The objective is practical: help researchers quickly see what is
new, how the pieces fit together, and where important gaps remain. We summarize
tools for estimating changing infection or reaction rates under noisy and
incomplete observations, modeling spatial spread, accounting for sudden jumps
and heavy tails, and reporting uncertainty in a way that is useful for
decisions. We also highlight open problems that deserve near-term attention:
separating true dynamics from noise when data are irregular; learning spatial
dynamics under random influences with guarantees of stability; aligning
training with the numerical method used in applications; preserving positivity
and conservation in all simulations; reducing cost while controlling error for
large studies; estimating rare but important events; and adopting clear,
comparable reporting standards. By organizing the field around these aims, the
review offers a concise guide to current methods, their practical use, and the
most promising directions for future work in biology and epidemiology.s.
