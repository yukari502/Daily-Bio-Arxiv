This simplistic assumption prevents models from\naccurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,\nparticularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely\nhindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The\nphysically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive\nalternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To\ndate, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and\noperational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.\nHere, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann\nMachine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum\nprocessor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its\nuse as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to\nmillion-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates\na latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,\nconsistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models\nlike VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type\nclassification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of\nintroducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire\nscientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This\nwork provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep\nlearning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable\nblueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u67b6\u6784QBM-VAE\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837Boltzmann\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u800cBoltzmann\u5206\u5e03\u867d\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u672a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQBM-VAE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u91c7\u6837Boltzmann\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cQBM-VAE\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982VAE\u3001SCVI\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "QBM-VAE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50AI\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\u3002"}}

We summarize\ntools for estimating changing infection or reaction rates under noisy and\nincomplete observations, modeling spatial spread, accounting for sudden jumps\nand heavy tails, and reporting uncertainty in a way that is useful for\ndecisions. We also highlight open problems that deserve near-term attention:\nseparating true dynamics from noise when data are irregular; learning spatial\ndynamics under random influences with guarantees of stability; aligning\ntraining with the numerical method used in applications; preserving positivity\nand conservation in all simulations; reducing cost while controlling error for\nlarge studies; estimating rare but important events; and adopting clear,\ncomparable reporting standards. By organizing the field around these aims, the\nreview offers a concise guide to current methods, their practical use, and the\nmost promising directions for future work in biology and epidemiology.s.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5feb\u901f\u4e86\u89e3\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6838\u5fc3\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u611f\u67d3\u7387\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5904\u7406\u7a81\u53d1\u8df3\u8dc3\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5982\u5206\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u3002"}}

While raw\ncounts or relative compositions are commonly used for such analysis, variations\nbetween clusters may be driven or distorted by subject-level covariates,\nreflecting underlying biological and clinical heterogeneity across individuals.\nSimultaneously detecting latent communities and identifying covariates that\ndifferentiate them can enhance our understanding of the microbiome and its\nassociation with health outcomes. To this end, we propose a\nDirichlet-multinomial mixture regression (DMMR) model that enables joint\nclustering of microbiome profiles while accounting for covariates with either\nhomogeneous or heterogeneous effects across clusters. A novel symmetric link\nfunction is introduced to facilitate covariate modeling through the\ncompositional parameters. We develop efficient algorithms with convergence\nguarantees for parameter estimation and establish theoretical properties of the\nproposed estimators. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the method in clustering, feature selection, and heterogeneity detection. We\nillustrate the utility of DMMR through a comprehensive application to\nupper-airway microbiota data from a pediatric asthma study, uncovering distinct\nmicrobial subtypes and their associations with clinical characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdDirichlet-multinomial\u6df7\u5408\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08DMMR\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u533a\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u8054\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u79f0\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aDMMR\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "DMMR\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u79d1\u54ee\u5598\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u4e9a\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}
