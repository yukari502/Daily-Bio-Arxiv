TL;DR: 一种利用深度学习模型从蜜蜂与花朵交互产生的电场信息中重建花朵形状的算法，揭示了节肢动物通过电感觉获取空间细节信息的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究节肢动物如蜜蜂如何利用环境电场信息来识别和重建花朵形状，以了解节肢动物环境知觉的机制

Method: 使用模拟的蜜蜂-花朵交互电场数据训练UNet深度学习模型，从电场信息中重建花瓣形状，并研究不同距离下的重建效果

Result: 模型能够准确重建多种花朵形状，包括训练集中未包含的复杂形状；重建性能在最佳蜜蜂-花朵距离处达到峰值

Conclusion: 电感觉能够传递丰富的空间细节信息，为节肢动物环境知觉提供了新的见解

Abstract: Arthropods, including pollinators, respond to environmental electrical
fields. Here, we show that electric field information can be decoded to
reconstruct environmental features. We develop an algorithm capable of
inferring the shapes of polarisable flowers from the electric field generated
by a nearby charged bee. We simulated electric fields arising from bee flower
interactions for flowers with varying petal geometries. These simulated data
were used to train a deep learning UNet model to recreate petal shapes. The
model accurately reconstructed diverse flower shapes including more complex
flower shapes not included in training. Reconstruction performance peaked at an
optimal bee flower distance, indicating distance-dependent encoding of shape
information. These findings show that electroreception can impart rich spatial
detail, offering insights into arthropod environmental perception.

TL;DR: 基于瞬时面部视频的彩龙计算平台，通过微峰分析和AI面部网格估计，在短时间采样中保持个人化统计功能，特别关注自闭症与普通发育的动力学差异。

Result: 开发出能够在5秒短视频中维持个人化统计功能的彩龙计算平台，成功捕捉面部微峰和情感微表情细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了区分自闭症与普通发育个体在动力学和几何模式上差异的新途径，为短时间数据采样领域带来重要进展。

Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult
to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief
data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume
normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in
biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as
gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking
brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is
achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in
time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent
advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and
nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially
the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as
well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to
differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals
from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.

*Kyle R. Allison*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了多组织菌英菌链模型，通过多组织相互作用网络来控制基因调控，解释了生物组织如何实现稳健的基因表达和可预测的多组织自组织过程。

Method: 以大肠菌索K-12为模型系统，分析多组织自组织过程中的物理和化学相互作用网络，提出多组织菌英菌链模型，将基因网络的输入与输出通过多组织相互作用连接起来。

Result: 多组织相互作用网络能够作为关键基因网络的输入，产生稳健的基因表达；同时多组织相互作用网络又是基因网络在自组织过程中的输出，形成了一种独特的生物控制机制。

Conclusion: 多组织菌英菌链是一种通用的机制，通过可靠地传播多组织群落和预测性地确定每个细胞在多组织自组织和发育过程中的基因网络输入，使得生物组织能够控制细胞行为并且比其部分之和更简单。

Abstract: Biological organisms are simple at heart: cells, their basic units, perform a
variety of behaviors by expressing proteins from DNA-encoded genes. Gene
expression though depends on sets of often-convoluted regulatory interactions
known as gene networks, contributing to biology's apparent complexity. Even in
Escherichia coli K-12, the pioneering model organism of molecular biology, gene
networks are complicated and inconsistent with gene expression data. Recent
discoveries of multicellular self-organization in E. coli suggest a new model
for gene regulation that may help in many cases: control of gene networks by
multicellular interaction networks, i.e. the changing physical and chemical
interactions between cells in communities. E. coli's observed dynamics indicate
multicellular interactions serve as inputs for key gene networks, thereby
producing robust expression of otherwise noisy genes. In turn, multicellular
interaction networks are dynamically generated as outputs of gene networks
during self-organization. Thus, multicellular self-organization enables
uniquely-biological control mechanisms that are not available to individual
cells. As further suggested by E. coli self-organization, the gene-network
outputs from one multicellular stage can be linked, via multicellular
interaction networks, to serve as the gene-network inputs for later stages,
thereby creating multicellular daisy chains. Daisy chains are a general model
for reliably propagating multicellular communities and, therefore, for
predictably determining the gene-network inputs of each cell throughout
multicellular self-organization and development. Considerations for several
fields are briefly discussed and suggest multicellular daisy chains are a
general mechanism for biological organisms to control cell behavior and to be
simpler than the sum of their parts.

Motivation: 研究槲皮素通过调节T细胞相关靶点抑制三阴性乳腺癌的机制，为TNBC免疫治疗提供新策略

Method: 整合单细胞RNA测序和网络药理学，通过PCA和UMAP聚类识别T细胞亚群，筛选TNBC相关靶点，进行分子对接和PPI网络验证

Result: 槲皮素与79个TNBC靶点相互作用，与GSK3B亲和力最高(-13.2 kJ/mol)，AKT1和MMP9表达与患者生存相关

Conclusion: 槲皮素可能通过多靶点调节T细胞功能逆转TNBC免疫抑制，但临床应用需要解决低生物利用度问题

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the mechanism by which quercetin inhibits
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) through regulating T-cell-related targets,
providing a novel strategy for TNBC immunotherapy.Methods: Single-cell RNA
sequencing (GSE161529 dataset) and network pharmacology were integrated. PCA
and UMAP clustering identified T-cell subsets and differentially expressed
genes in TNBC microenvironment. TNBC-related targets were screened via CTD and
OMIM databases, with functional pathways analyzed by GO/KEGG enrichment.
Molecular docking and PPI networks validated interactions between quercetin and
core targets.Results: Quercetin intersected with 79 TNBC targets, including
AKT1, EGFR, and MMP9, enriched in EGFR inhibitor resistance and endocrine
resistance pathways. Molecular docking revealed the highest affinity between
quercetin and GSK3B (-13.2 kJ/mol). AKT1 and MMP9 expression correlated with
patient survival.Conclusion: Quercetin may reverse TNBC immunosuppression by
multi-target modulation of T-cell function, but clinical application requires
solutions for its low bioavailability, such as delivery systems or combination
therapies.

### [5] [Segmenting Thalamic Nuclei: T1 Maps Provide a Reliable and Efficient Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12508)
*Anqi Feng,Zhangxing Bian,Samuel W. Remedios,Savannah P. Hays,Blake E. Dewey,Jiachen Zhuo,Dan Benjamini,Jerry L. Prince*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估多种MRI对比度输入对胺体核团分割的效果，发现T1地图单独使用即可获得优秀的定量和定性结果，而PD地图无额外价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的胺体核团分割对理解神经系统疾病和应用临床干预至关重要，但最优的MRI输入方案仍不明确。需要系统评估不同对比度输入的效果。

Method: 系统评估MPRAGE、FGATIR、定量PD和T1地图、以及不同反转时间的多个T1加权图像。对多TI图像采用梯度基准显著性分析和Monte Carlo dropout方法，提出综合重要性得分来选择最佳图像。使用3D U-Net训练每种配置。

Result: T1地图单独使用即可获得强劲的定量表现和优秀的定性结果，PD地图则无额外价值。T1地图在所有评估选项中表现最优。

Conclusion: T1地图是胺体核团分割的可靠高效输入选择，为临床或研究应用中的成像协议优化提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation is crucial for understanding
neurological diseases, brain functions, and guiding clinical interventions.
However, the optimal inputs for segmentation remain unclear. This study
systematically evaluates multiple MRI contrasts, including MPRAGE and FGATIR
sequences, quantitative PD and T1 maps, and multiple T1-weighted images at
different inversion times (multi-TI), to determine the most effective inputs.
For multi-TI images, we employ a gradient-based saliency analysis with Monte
Carlo dropout and propose an Overall Importance Score to select the images
contributing most to segmentation. A 3D U-Net is trained on each of these
configurations. Results show that T1 maps alone achieve strong quantitative
performance and superior qualitative outcomes, while PD maps offer no added
value. These findings underscore the value of T1 maps as a reliable and
efficient input among the evaluated options, providing valuable guidance for
optimizing imaging protocols when thalamic structures are of clinical or
research interest.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mantis是一个基于机制模拟训练的基础模型，无需真实数据即可在多种疾病和场景中进行准确预测，性能超越39个专家调优模型，提供8周预测范围且具有机制可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统传染病预测模型需要疾病特定数据、定制化训练和专家调优的问题，特别是在新发疫情或资源匮乏地区的预测挑战

Method: 基于超过4亿天爆发动态的机制模拟训练，涵盖多种病原体、传播模式、干预措施和监测伪影，完全无需真实世界数据

Result: 在6种疾病测试中超越所有39个专家调优模型，包括CDC COVID-19预测中心的所有模型，能够泛化到新的流行病学机制，提供8周预测范围

Conclusion: Mantis作为下一代疾病预测系统的基础，具有通用性、可解释性和在传统模型失败场景中的部署能力

Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low resource settings
has been limited by the need for disease-specific data, bespoke training, and
expert tuning. We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on
mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across
diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data.
Mantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics
spanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance
artifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis
outperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including
all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel
epidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission
mechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics.
Critically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health
decision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions. Finally,
Mantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the
actionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning.
Together, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for
next-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and
deployable where traditional models fail.

Conclusion: 该框架为分子动态系统提供了根因分析的新视角，通过捕捉分子相互作用条件分布的移动来理解结合事件的因果机制

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including
resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect
"interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds
between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in
identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation
-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence
over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal
data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these
phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims
to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation
events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an
"intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and
separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models
are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us
to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal
graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step
to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal
models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional
distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,
this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular
dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the
atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we
can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the
observed changes in the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然贝叶斯网络推理算法不断发展，但预测结果往往受到特定计算算法的不透明影响，需要一种方法来减少这种算法依赖性

Method: 采用"群体智慧"策略，开发了集成学习框架BaMANI，整合多种贝叶斯网络推理算法进行因果网络推断

Result: 开发了BaMANI软件工具，并在人类乳腺癌研究中进行了应用验证

Conclusion: 集成学习方法能够有效减少单一算法对贝叶斯因果网络推理结果的影响，提高预测的稳健性和可靠性

Abstract: Improved computational power has enabled different disciplines to predict
causal relationships among modeled variables using Bayesian network inference.
While many alternative algorithms have been proposed to improve the efficiency
and reliability of network prediction, the predicted causal networks reflect
the generative process but also bear an opaque imprint of the specific
computational algorithm used. Following a ``wisdom of the crowds" strategy, we
developed an ensemble learning approach to marginalize the impact of a single
algorithm on Bayesian causal network inference. To introduce the approach, we
first present the theoretical foundation of this framework. Next, we present a
comprehensive implementation of the framework in terms of a new software tool
called BaMANI (Bayesian Multi-Algorithm causal Network Inference). Finally, we
describe a BaMANI use-case from biology, particularly within human breast
cancer studies.

### [9] [ProtTeX-CC: Activating In-Context Learning in Protein LLM via Two-Stage Instruction Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12212)
*Chuanliu Fan,Zicheng Ma,Jun Gao,Nan Yu,Jun Zhang,Ziqiang Cao,Yi Qin Gao,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtTeX-CC是一个轻量级的两阶段压缩框架，通过联合嵌入压缩和自压缩模块，显著减少蛋白质输入长度和演示长度，提升ProtTeX模型在少样本设置下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ProtTeX模型的两个主要限制：序列和结构标记的拼接导致蛋白质长度翻倍并破坏模态对齐；受限于训练语料和上下文窗口，无法进行上下文学习，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 两阶段压缩框架：1) 联合嵌入压缩机制在残基级别融合序列和结构表示，将蛋白质输入长度减半；2) 自压缩模块将完整演示聚合到最后几个语言标记的潜在空间中，大幅减少演示长度。

Result: 在16-shot设置下实现约93.68%的总提示长度压缩比。蛋白质功能预测实验中，域内基准性能提升2%，域外数据集性能提升11%。

Conclusion: ProtTeX-CC通过有效的压缩策略显著提升了ProtTeX模型的效率和泛化能力，仅需少量额外参数即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein large language models, such as ProtTeX, represent
both side-chain amino acids and backbone structure as discrete token sequences
of residue length. While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal
protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The
concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the
protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between
modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,
ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it
incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its
generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a
lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under
few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that
fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively
reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then
we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration
into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average
demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the
original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of
approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.
Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number
of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding
compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the
self-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction
show that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and
generalizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%.

Motivation: 肽胆原纤肽胆氧化预测是生物信息学重点领域，当前方法主要基于进化模体和氨基酸特性，序列信息特征显示出高预测性能。

Method: 利用预训练的蛋白质大语言模型提取序列上下文特征，构建双向LSTM和GRU深度学习模型进行肽胆原纤肽胆氧化区域预测。

Conclusion: 证明了大语言模型在提高肽胆原纤肽胆氧化预测准确性方面的潜力，为该领域提供了新的计算方法。

Abstract: The prediction of amyloidogenicity in peptides and proteins remains a focal
point of ongoing bioinformatics. The crucial step in this field is to apply
advanced computational methodologies. Many recent approaches to predicting
amyloidogenicity within proteins are highly based on evolutionary motifs and
the individual properties of amino acids. It is becoming increasingly evident
that the sequence information-based features show high predictive performance.
Consequently, our study evaluated the contextual features of protein sequences
obtained from a pretrained protein large language model leveraging
bidirectional LSTM and GRU to predict amyloidogenic regions in peptide and
protein sequences. Our method achieved an accuracy of 84.5% on 10-fold
cross-validation and an accuracy of 83% in the test dataset. Our results
demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs in
enhancing the accuracy of amyloid prediction.

TL;DR: 开发了一个随机基于代理的模型来模拟肿瘤-免疫相互作用，整合了细胞异质性、空间相互作用和耐药性演化，用于评估不同治疗策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤-免疫相互作用对癌症进展和治疗结果至关重要，需要开发能够捕捉细胞异质性和空间动态的计算模型来优化治疗策略。

Method: 使用随机基于代理的模型，在二维微环境中模拟四种主要细胞类型（肿瘤细胞、细胞毒性T细胞、辅助T细胞、调节性T细胞）的动态行为，包括增殖、凋亡、迁移和免疫调节等关键生物过程。

Result: 模拟重现了免疫特权等涌现现象，所有治疗均能不同程度抑制肿瘤生长并重塑肿瘤微环境。联合治疗（特别是靶向治疗+免疫治疗）效果最佳，能有效控制肿瘤并延迟耐药性出现。敏感性分析显示治疗强度与疗效存在非线性关系。

Conclusion: 基于代理的建模能有效捕捉复杂肿瘤-免疫动态，为优化癌症治疗策略提供了可扩展、生物学可解释的计算平台，适合未来与实验或临床数据整合。

Abstract: Tumor-immune interactions are central to cancer progression and treatment
outcomes. In this study, we present a stochastic agent-based model that
integrates cellular heterogeneity, spatial cell-cell interactions, and drug
resistance evolution to simulate tumor growth and immune response in a
two-dimensional microenvironment. The model captures dynamic behaviors of four
major cell types--tumor cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T cells, and
regulatory T cells--and incorporates key biological processes such as
proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and immune regulation. Using this
framework, we simulate tumor progression under different therapeutic
interventions, including radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint
blockade. Our simulations reproduce emergent phenomena such as immune privilege
and spatial immune exclusion. Quantitative analyses show that all therapies
suppress tumor growth to varying degrees and reshape the tumor
microenvironment. Notably, combination therapies--especially targeted therapy
with immunotherapy--achieve the most effective tumor control and delay the
emergence of resistance. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal a nonlinear
relationship between treatment intensity and therapeutic efficacy, highlighting
the existence of optimal dosing thresholds. This work demonstrates the utility
of agent-based modeling in capturing complex tumor-immune dynamics and provides
a computational platform for optimizing cancer treatment strategies. The model
is extensible, biologically interpretable, and well-suited for future
integration with experimental or clinical data.
