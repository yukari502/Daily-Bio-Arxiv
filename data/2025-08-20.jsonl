Existing modeling\nparadigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor\nregulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network\nstructure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the\nProbabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical\napproach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies.\nFirstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and\ncomposition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs)\nserve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic\ncellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as\nprobability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end\ngenerative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior\ndistribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is\nachieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample\nnetwork topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to\npredict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework\nprovides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and\nuncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and\nsystems-level analysis."}
