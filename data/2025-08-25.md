TL;DR: 通过结合某亚马模型和染色质结构的模拟研究，发现DNA双链断裂导致的sirtuin重新定位会引起表观遗传洞头的失稳定，而染色质的空间组织可以缓冲这种破坏效应。

Motivation: 表观遗传洞头在维持细胞身份和组织稳态中至关重要，但它们对毒性基因组压力如DNA双链断裂的响应仍不完全明了。

Method: 使用随机模型模拟组系脚修漏头动态并结合染色质结构，研究sirtuin置换导致的表观遗传洞头失稳定机制。

Result: 模拟结果重现了sirtuin重新定位导致表观遗传洞头消体的实验发现，显示结果取决于酶水平和染色质几何结构，具有长程接触域的区域更容易抵御失稳定。

Conclusion: 染色质折叠结构可以缓冲细胞酶重新定位的影响，为维持压力下表观遗传洞头完整性提供了结构机制。

Abstract: Epigenetic landscapes, represented by patterns of chemical modifications on
histone tails, are essential for maintaining cell identity and tissue
homeostasis. These landscapes are shaped by multiple factors, including local
biochemical signals and the three-dimensional organisation of chromatin.
However, their response to genomic stress, such as DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs), remains incompletely understood. Here, we use a stochastic model of
histone modification dynamics integrated with chromatin architecture to
investigate how local depletion of sirtuins, histone deacetylases involved in
DSB repair, destabilises epigenetic patterns. Our simulations recapitulate
experimental findings in which sirtuin relocalisation to DSB sites leads to the
epigenetic erosion and suggest that the resulting landscape depends on enzyme
levels and chromatin geometry. Importantly, chromatin regions with large
domains of long-range contacts are more resilient to epigenetic
destabilisation. These findings suggest that chromatin folding can buffer
against relocation of histone-modifying enzymes, highlighting a structural
mechanism for preserving epigenetic integrity under stress.

### [2] [From Cancer Drivers to Cancer Keepers: Paradigm Shift and Clinical Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16128)
*Xizhe Zhang,Weixiong Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 论文提出从传统的癌症驱动基因(CDG)范式转向癌症守护基因(CKG)范式，强调靶向维持肿瘤状态的非突变基因，以克服治疗耐药性并实现更持久的癌症控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统驱动基因范式存在局限性：广泛出现的治疗耐药性、健康组织中存在驱动突变、许多肿瘤缺乏可识别驱动基因，需要转向系统层面的癌症理解。

Method: 采用网络可控性视角，引入癌症守护基因(CKG)概念，关注维持肿瘤状态的关键基因，包括DNA损伤应答、蛋白质稳态和代谢等过程相关基因。

Result: 提出了基于CKG的癌症治疗新范式，强调靶向非驱动但维持肿瘤状态的基因，这代表精准肿瘤学的关键演进。

Conclusion: 靶向维持肿瘤脆弱性的非驱动CKG基因是克服治疗挑战、实现更持久癌症控制的有前景策略，标志着向旨在瓦解维持恶性肿瘤网络的疗法转变。

Abstract: Cancer research has traditionally focused on identifying driver genes, those
with mutations that initiate tumorigenesis. The Cancer Driver Gene (CDG)
paradigm, further supported by the observation of oncogene addiction in tumors,
has successfully guided the development of targeted therapies. However, the
limitations of this driver-centric view, highlighted by the broad emergence of
frequent therapeutic resistance, the presence of driver mutations in healthy
tissues or individuals, and the lack of identifiable drivers in many tumors,
call for a shift in perspective and clinical practice. The latest network
controllability perspective on cancer cells introduced the concept of Cancer
Keeper Genes (CKGs) and a CKG-based paradigm for cancer therapeutics. The new
concept encompasses the concept of non-oncogene addiction, emphasizing reliance
on non-mutated pathways crucial for maintaining oncogenic cellular states.
Here, we explore the transition towards a system-level understanding of cancer
based on the CKG paradigm, emphasizing the essential role of genes required for
tumor maintenance, irrespective of their initiating function or mutational
capacity. We discuss clinical implications of this paradigm shift, highlighting
the progress made so far and potential of targeting non-driver CKGs, genes
involved in processes like DNA damage response, proteostasis, and metabolism,
as a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic challenges and achieve more
durable cancer control. Targeting these maintenance vulnerabilities represents
a critical evolution in precision oncology, moving towards therapies designed
to dismantle the networks sustaining malignancies.
