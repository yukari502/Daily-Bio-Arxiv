Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合临床变量和基因表达特征的乳腺癌生存预测模型，使用弹性网络惩罚Cox回归和随机生存森林，在METABRIC队列中验证了整合模型的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的乳腺癌生存预测对于患者分层和个性化治疗至关重要，整合基因表达数据和临床因素可能提高预后性能并支持精准医疗。

Method: 分析了METABRIC队列中1,867名患者的临床注释和微阵列基因表达数据，使用弹性网络惩罚Cox回归识别75个预测因子（70个基因和5个临床变量），并通过随机生存森林评估非线性效应和变量重要性。

Result: 整合Cox模型获得C-index为0.922和36个月AUC为0.94，显著优于仅临床模型（C=0.64）。随机生存森林确认了关键基因的预后价值，获得36个月AUC为0.88。

Conclusion: 基因表达特征与临床变量的结合显著提高了乳腺癌生存预测准确性，为个体化预后评估和临床决策提供了框架。

Abstract: Background: Accurate survival prediction in breast cancer is essential for
patient stratification and personalized therapy. Integrating gene expression
data with clinical factors may enhance prognostic performance and support
precision medicine. Objective: To develop an integrative survival prediction
model combining clinical variables and gene expression signatures, and to
assess their contributions using penalized Cox regression and machine learning.
Methods: We analyzed 1,867 patients from the METABRIC cohort with clinical
annotations and microarray-based gene expression profiles. The top 5,000 most
variable genes were retained. Elastic Net-penalized Cox regression identified
75 predictors (70 genes and 5 clinical variables: tumor size, stage, surgery
type, age at diagnosis, and Nottingham Prognostic Index). Model performance was
evaluated with Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and 36-month
time-dependent AUC. Random Survival Forests (RSF) trained on the top 20 genes
assessed nonlinear effects and validated variable importance. PCA and heatmaps
visualized gene expression patterns across risk groups. Results: The
integrative Cox model achieved a C-index of 0.922 and a 36-month AUC of 0.94,
outperforming clinical-only models (C=0.64). RSF confirmed the prognostic value
of top genes (e.g., OR2T27, TBATA, LINC01165, SLC10A4), yielding a 36-month AUC
of 0.88. Conclusions: Combining gene expression signatures with clinical
variables substantially improves survival prediction in breast cancer and
provides a framework for individualized prognostic assessment and clinical
decision-making.

### [2] [Lie-RMSD: A Gradient-Based Framework for Protein Structural Alignment using Lie Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17010)
*Yue Hu,Zanxia Cao,Yingchao Liu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了Lie-RMSD，一种基于李代数的完全可微分蛋白质结构比对框架，使用梯度下降优化器实现与Kabsch算法相当的精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分析方法如Kabsch算法仅限于RMSD指标，无法处理更复杂的生物相关评分函数。深度学习框架为这类优化问题提供了新的灵活范式

Method: 将刚体变换表示为特殊欧几里得群SE(3)的李代数se(3)中的6维向量，将RMSD构建为可直接通过梯度优化器最小化的损失函数

Result: 在腺苷酸激酶变构构象比对中，多种标准优化器（SGD、Adam、AdamW、Sophia）都能稳健收敛到全局最小值，精度与Kabsch算法基本相同

Conclusion: 验证了基于李代数的梯度下降方法的准确性，为扩展到更复杂、无解析解的生物学相关评分函数奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: The comparison of protein structures is a fundamental task in computational
biology, crucial for understanding protein function, evolution, and for drug
design. While analytical methods like the Kabsch algorithm provide an exact,
closed-form solution for minimizing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)
between two sets of corresponding atoms, their application is limited to this
specific metric. The rise of deep learning and automatic differentiation
frameworks offers a new, more flexible paradigm for such optimization problems.
We present Lie-RMSD, a novel, fully differentiable framework for protein
structural alignment. Our method represents the rigid-body transformation
(rotation and translation) as a 6-dimensional vector in the Lie algebra se(3)
of the special Euclidean group SE(3). This representation allows the RMSD to be
formulated as a loss function that can be directly minimized by modern
gradient-based optimizers. We benchmarked our framework by aligning two
allosteric conformations of Adenylate Kinase (PDB IDs: 4AKE and 1AKE). We
demonstrate that a suite of standard optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Sophia)
can robustly converge to the global minimum, achieving precision effectively
identical to the analytical Kabsch algorithm. This work validates the accuracy
of the Lie algebra-based gradient descent approach and establishes a robust
foundation for its extension to more sophisticated and biologically relevant
scoring functions where no analytical solutions exist.

### [3] [Neural Proteomics Fields for Super-resolved Spatial Proteomics Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17389)
*Bokai Zhao,Weiyang Shi,Hanqing Chao,Zijiang Yang,Yiyang Zhang,Ming Song,Tianzi Jiang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于测序空间蛋白质组学空间超分辨率任务（seq-SP）的深度学习模型NPF，通过连续空间蛋白质重建和双模块架构实现优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测序空间蛋白质组学技术存在空间分辨率低、组织间蛋白表达变异大的问题，现有分子数据预测方法性能受限

Method: NPF模型将seq-SP建模为连续空间蛋白质重建问题，包含空间建模模块（学习组织特异性蛋白空间分布）和形态建模模块（提取组织特异性形态特征），每个组织训练专用网络

Result: NPF在建立的Pseudo-Visium SP基准数据集上达到最先进性能，且参数量更少

Conclusion: NPF模型具有推动空间蛋白质组学研究的潜力，代码和数据集已开源

Abstract: Spatial proteomics maps protein distributions in tissues, providing
transformative insights for life sciences. However, current sequencing-based
technologies suffer from low spatial resolution, and substantial inter-tissue
variability in protein expression further compromises the performance of
existing molecular data prediction methods. In this work, we introduce the
novel task of spatial super-resolution for sequencing-based spatial proteomics
(seq-SP) and, to the best of our knowledge, propose the first deep learning
model for this task--Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF). NPF formulates seq-SP as a
protein reconstruction problem in continuous space by training a dedicated
network for each tissue. The model comprises a Spatial Modeling Module, which
learns tissue-specific protein spatial distributions, and a Morphology Modeling
Module, which extracts tissue-specific morphological features. Furthermore, to
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we establish an open-source benchmark dataset,
Pseudo-Visium SP, for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF
achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters,
underscoring its potential for advancing spatial proteomics research. Our code
and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Bokai-Zhao/NPF.

### [4] [Comprehensively stratifying MCIs into distinct risk subtypes based on brain imaging genetics fusion learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18058)
*Muheng Shang,Jin Zhang,Junwei Han,Lei Du*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究通过融合多模态脑成像遗传数据，将轻度认知障碍(MCI)患者分为低风险和高风险亚型，为阿尔茨海默病的早期患者分层提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCI作为阿尔茨海默病的前驱阶段具有显著的异质性，准确筛选合适的临床试验受试者面临挑战，需要开发能够区分不同风险亚型的方法。

Method: 采用三模块整合成像遗传学方法：全基因组风险遗传信息提取模块(RGE)、遗传到脑映射模块(RG2PG)和遗传引导的伪脑融合模块(CMPF)，基于ADNI数据进行分析。

Result: 成功识别出低风险MCI(lsMCI)和高风险MCI(hsMCI)两种亚型，验证了它们在遗传、人口统计、流体生物标志物、脑成像特征、临床症状和认知功能等多方面的显著差异。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效区分MCI患者的风险等级，为早期患者分层提供了重要见解，并识别出可能暗示MCI风险的潜在生物标志物。

Abstract: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease
(AD) and thus enrolling MCI subjects to undergo clinical trials is worthwhile.
However, MCI groups usually show significant diversity and heterogeneity in the
pathology and symptom, which pose great challenge to accurately select
appropriate subjects. This study aimed to stratify MCI subjects into distinct
subgroups with substantial difference in the risk of transitioning to AD by
fusing multimodal brain imaging genetic data. The integrated imaging genetics
method comprised three modules, i.e., the whole-genome-oriented risk genetic
information extraction module (RGE), the genetic-to-brain mapping module
(RG2PG), and the genetic-guided pseudo-brain fusion module (CMPF). We used data
from AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and identified two MCI subtypes, called
low-risk MCI (lsMCI) and high-risk MCI (hsMCI). We also validated that the two
subgroups showed distinct patterns of in terms of multiple biomarkers including
genetics, demographics, fluid biomarkers, brain imaging features, clinical
symptoms and cognitive functioning at baseline, as well as their longitudinal
developmental trajectories. Furthermore, we also identified potential
biomarkers that may implicate the risk of MCIs, providing critical insights for
patient stratification at early stage.

Method: 采用新颖的无监督域适应方法，结合少量专家标注的真实标签数据和大量未标注数据进行训练

Result: 定量和定性评估均显示该方法显著优于现有最先进方法

Abstract: This work presents a novel deep learning framework for segmenting cerebral
vasculature in hyperspectral brain images. We address the critical challenge of
severe label scarcity, which impedes conventional supervised training. Our
approach utilizes a novel unsupervised domain adaptation methodology, using a
small, expert-annotated ground truth alongside unlabeled data. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluations confirm that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of domain
adaptation for label-scarce biomedical imaging tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过9种CAM技术在脑出血诊断中实现可解释AI，在EfficientNetV2S第5阶段获得最佳定位性能，HiResCAM和AblationCAM分别取得最佳边界框对齐和像素级分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高深度学习模型在医学影像中的透明度和临床信任度，通过可解释AI技术增强脑出血诊断的可信度。

Method: 开发了一个pipeline，使用9种最先进的CAM算法从分类模型中提取像素级分割和检测标注，在Hemorica数据集上进行定量评估，采用Dice、IoU和像素重叠等指标。

Result: 在EfficientNetV2S第5阶段获得最佳定位性能，HiResCAM实现最高边界框对齐，AblationCAM获得最佳像素级Dice(0.57)和IoU(0.40)。

Conclusion: 这是首批定量比较CAM方法用于脑出血检测的研究之一，建立了可复现的基准，证明了XAI驱动pipeline在临床AI辅助诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

### [7] [Arnold: a generalist muscle transformer policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18066)
*Alberto Silvio Chiappa,Boshi An,Merkourios Simos,Chengkun Li,Alexander Mathis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 开发了Arnold通用策略，通过行为克隆和PPO微调，在14个复杂控制任务中实现专家级性能，使用传感器运动词汇和Transformer架构处理多任务多体现学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维非线性人体肌肉骨骼模型的控制挑战，现有方法只能掌握单一技能，需要开发能够掌握多任务和多体现的通用策略。

Method: 结合行为克隆和PPO微调，创新性地使用传感器运动词汇作为异构感官模态、目标和执行器的组合表示，通过Transformer架构处理可变观察和动作空间。

Result: 在14个挑战性控制任务（从灵巧物体操作到运动）中达到专家或超专家级性能，支持高效的多任务多体现学习并促进对新任务的快速适应。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物运动控制提供了新见解，证实了肌肉协同作用在跨任务中可转移性有限的最新发现，为通用运动控制策略开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

### [8] [A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty - with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803)
*Yu Wang,Xiao Chen,Hubert Schwarz,Véronique Chotteau,Elling W. Jacobsen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出基于模块化的预测滤波器方法，结合自适应约束边界和约束违反成本监控，用于处理过程优化控制中的约束问题，特别适用于存在模型不确定性和干扰的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来学习型方法在生物生产等领域受到关注，但在不确定性下的约束处理仍具挑战性，需要开发能够有效处理软约束违反成本的方法。

Method: 采用模块化设计的预测滤波器，通过最小二乘法最小化修改控制器输出，确保在预测时域内满足约束条件，结合自适应约束边界和约束违反成本监控机制。

Result: 该方法计算高效，适合实时应用，在糖基化约束满足的连续单克隆抗体生物类似物生产仿真案例中表现出良好效果，模型包含23种胞外代谢物和126个反应。

Conclusion: 提出的约束处理器模块化设计灵活，可与任何控制器结合，有效处理模型不确定性和干扰导致的软约束违反问题，在生物生产过程优化中具有实用价值。

Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process
optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in
learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint
handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler,
called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a
constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft
constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be
combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller
output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within
the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and
suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is
illustrated through a realistic simulation case study of glycosylation
constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production
using Chinese hamster ovary cells, for which the metabolic network model
consists of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions.

TL;DR: 开发深度学习模型从非对比MRI预测脑肿瘤对比增强，在11089例MRI数据上训练，性能优于专家放射科医生，准确率达83%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆对比剂在频繁随访、肾功能不全、过敏或儿科患者中不可取，需要开发无需对比剂的脑肿瘤增强检测方法

Method: 使用nnU-Net、SegResNet、SwinUNETR等深度学习模型，仅基于非对比T1、T2、T2/FLAIR加权图像预测和分割增强肿瘤

Result: 最佳模型nnU-Net检测增强肿瘤的平衡准确率达83%，敏感性91.5%，特异性74.4%，增强体积预测与真实值强相关(R² 0.859)，性能优于专家放射科医生

Conclusion: 深度学习可从非对比MRI识别对比增强脑肿瘤，具有临床相关性能，有望作为筛查工具并减少神经肿瘤成像对钆的依赖

Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and
post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such
as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We
aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of predicting brain
tumour contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI sequences alone. We assembled
11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets spanning adult and
paediatric populations with various neuro-oncological states, including glioma,
meningioma, metastases, and post-resection appearances. Deep learning models
(nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing
tumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images.
Performance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level
detection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were
compared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected
patients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5%
sensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement
volume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model
outperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9%
sensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3
(acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had
Dice over 0.7 (excellent detection). Deep learning can identify
contrast-enhancing brain tumours from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant
performance. These models show promise as screening tools and may reduce
gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging. Future work should evaluate
clinical utility alongside radiology experts.

### [10] [Boltzina: Efficient and Accurate Virtual Screening via Docking-Guided Binding Prediction with Boltz-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17555)
*Kairi Furui,Masahito Ohue*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Boltzina是一个新型虚拟筛选框架，在保持Boltz-2高精度的同时显著提升计算效率，通过跳过结构预测步骤直接从AutoDock Vina对接构象预测亲和力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Boltz-2虽然预测精度极高但计算耗时过长（约20秒/化合物/GPU），难以应用于大规模化合物库筛选的问题

Method: 省略Boltz-2中的限速结构预测步骤，直接从AutoDock Vina对接构象预测亲和力，通过减少循环迭代和批处理提升效率

Result: 在MF-PCBA数据集的8个测试中，Boltzina性能低于Boltz-2但显著优于AutoDock Vina和GNINA，计算速度提升最高达11.8倍

Conclusion: 首次将Boltz-2的高精度预测应用于实际规模筛选，提供了在计算生物学中兼顾精度和效率的解决方案

Abstract: In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional
molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations
in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely
high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20
seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale
screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study
proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy
while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both
accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from
Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina
docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show
that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher
screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally,
Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\times$ faster through reduced recycling
iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose
selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2,
presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to
application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply
Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a
pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.

introduce the Shortlisting Model (SLM), a novel simplex-based diffusion model
inspired by progressive candidate pruning. SLM operates on simplex centroids,
reducing generation complexity and enhancing scalability. Additionally, SLM
incorporates a flexible implementation of classifier-free guidance, enhancing
