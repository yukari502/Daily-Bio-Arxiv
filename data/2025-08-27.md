### [1] [scI2CL: Effectively Integrating Single-cell Multi-omics by Intra- and Inter-omics Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18304)
*Wuchao Liu,Han Peng,Wengen Li,Yichao Zhang,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: scI2CL是一个基于内外组学对比学习的单细胞多组学融合框架，能够从互补的多组学数据中学习全面且具有区分性的细胞表示，在多种下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞多组学数据包含丰富的细胞状态信息，但细胞分化发育是连续动态过程，基于这些数据计算建模和推断细胞相互作用模式仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出scI2CL框架，基于内外组学对比学习，从互补的多组学数据中学习综合且具有区分性的细胞表示。

Result: 在四个下游任务中验证有效性：细胞聚类超越8种现有方法；细胞亚型分析发现三个潜在单核细胞亚群；正确构建细胞发育轨迹；解决CD4+T细胞亚群的错误分类问题。

Conclusion: scI2CL能够准确表征细胞间的跨组学关系，有效融合多组学数据并学习具有区分性的细胞表示，支持各种下游分析任务。

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and
analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity,
diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \&
development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to
computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell
multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics
fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn
comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary
multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over
existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight
state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell
subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell
subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously,
scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental
trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In
addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two
subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely
distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize
cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data
and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various
downstream analysis tasks.

### [3] [Adding a Storage Pool improves 3-PG Tree-ring Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18327)
*Yanfang Wang,Liang Wei,Liheng Zhong,Xizi Yu,Pengtao Huang,Fang Wang,John D. Marshall*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究通过增强3-PG森林生长模型的生理学描述，特别是添加碳储存池用于年轮形成，显著提高了对年轮宽度和碳稳定同位素δ13C的模拟精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树轮提供了树木生长和气候变化的长期记录，是森林建模的理想基准。为了利用树轮信息提高3-PG模型的可靠性，需要增强其生理学描述能力。

Method: 主要升级包括：1）添加碳储存池用于年轮形成的碳水化合物储存；2）用高度调节器替代年龄调节器；3）基于两个大冷杉林分进行模型测试。

Result: 更新后的模型显著改善了年轮宽度和δ13C的模拟效果，达到了目前最好的树轮δ13C模拟水平，两个林分的模拟与观测相关性R²分别达到0.50和0.73。

Conclusion: 由于改进了树木生理学描述并提供了比先前版本更准确的树轮模拟，更新后的3-PG模型在使用树轮信息作为基准时能提供更可靠的模拟结果。

Abstract: Tree rings provide long-term records of tree growth and climate changes,
which makes them ideal benchmarks for forest modeling. Tree-ring information
has greatly improved the reliability of 3-PG, which is one of the most commonly
used process-based forest growth models. Here we strengthen 3-PGs ability to
simulate tree-ring width and carbon stable isotopes ({\delta}13C) by enhancing
its descriptions of tree physiology. The major upgrade was adding a carbon
storage pool for tree-ring formation using stored carbohydrates. We also
incorporated previous modifications (replacing the age modifier with a height
modifier) of 3-PG and tested their efficacy in improving tree-ring simulations.
We ran the model based on two grand fir (Abies grandis) stands. The updated
model greatly improved the simulations for both tree-ring widths and
{\delta}13C. The results represent one of the best tree-ring {\delta}13C
simulations, which accurately captured the amplitude in annual variations of
{\delta}13C. The correlations (R2) between simulations and observations reached
0.50 and 0.73 at two stands respectively. The new model also greatly improved
the simulations of raw tree-ring widths and detrended ring-widths index.
Because of better descriptions of tree physiology and more accurate simulations
of tree rings than the previous model version, the updated 3-PG should provide
more reliable simulations than previous 3-PG versions when tree-ring
information is used as benchmark in future studies.

TL;DR: 本文提供了一个关于一维血流模拟的完整指南，整合了理论推导和实际实现细节，包括控制方程、数值方法、边界条件和连接处理等关键组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管一维血流模拟在心血管研究中广泛应用，但缺乏一个将理论推导与实际实现细节整合的统一、逐步指南。

Method: 总结了包括降阶控制方程推导、特征线方法（黎曼不变量）、基于有限体积的数值格式、边界条件（反射/非反射和3元素Windkessel出口边界）、连接处理等关键组件，并提供了详细的逐步实现指导。

Result: 提供了一个综合性的指南，整合了严谨的理论和实际实现指导，提高了1D血流模拟的可访问性。

Conclusion: 该指南将成为心血管建模领域新手和有经验研究人员的宝贵资源和基础参考。

Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) blood flow simulations are extensively used in
cardiovascular research due to their computational efficiency and effectiveness
in analyzing pulse wave dynamics. Despite their versatility and simplicity,
there is a lack of a unified, step-by-step guide integrating theoretical
derivations with practical implementation details. In this work, we summarize
key components for comprehensive 1D blood flow simulations, including the
derivation of reduced-order governing equations, the method of characteristics
(Riemann invariants), a finite volume-based numerical scheme, boundary
conditions (application of Riemann invariants for reflective/non-reflective and
3-element Windkessel outlet boundaries), junction treatments, verification of
presented methodologies, and relevant practical applications. Additionally, we
provide detailed step-by-step instructions for implementing the numerical
scheme, applying boundary conditions, and treatment of junctions. By
integrating rigorous theory with practical guidance for implementation, we seek
to improve accessibility of 1D blood flow simulations. We anticipate that this
guide will serve as a valuable resource and foundational reference for both
novice and experienced researchers in cardiovascular modeling.

### [7] [Learning Explainable Imaging-Genetics Associations Related to a Neurological Disorder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18303)
*Jueqi Wang,Zachary Jacokes,John Darrell Van Horn,Michael C. Schatz,Kevin A. Pelphrey,Archana Venkataraman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroPathX是一个可解释的深度学习框架，通过交叉注意力机制融合脑部MRI结构变异和基因通路数据，用于分析神经疾病的成像遗传学关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成像遗传学方法局限于简单线性模型或缺乏可解释性的黑盒技术，无法有效捕捉脑部结构与遗传变异之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 采用早期融合策略和交叉注意力机制，引入两个损失函数：稀疏性损失关注最显著交互，通路相似性损失确保队列间表示一致性。

Result: 在自闭症谱系障碍和阿尔茨海默病验证中，NeuroPathX优于基线方法，揭示了与疾病相关的生物学可信关联。

Conclusion: NeuroPathX有潜力推进对复杂脑部疾病的理解，代码已开源。

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

### [8] [Sparse Autoencoders for Low-$N$ Protein Function Prediction and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18567)
*Darin Tsui,Kunal Talreja,Amirali Aghazadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器(SAEs)在蛋白质功能预测和设计中表现出色，特别是在数据稀缺情况下，仅需24个序列就能超越ESM2基线模型，并在83%的情况下生成高适应性变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺(低N)情况下从氨基酸序列预测蛋白质功能的挑战，特别是在只有少量标记序列功能数据时，机器学习指导的蛋白质设计受到限制。

Method: 使用在微调ESM2嵌入上训练的稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，评估其在多样化适应性外推和蛋白质工程任务中的表现，通过稀疏潜在空间分解蛋白质语言模型的嵌入。

Result: SAEs仅需24个序列就能在适应性预测中持续优于或与ESM2基线竞争，其稀疏潜在空间编码了紧凑且具有生物学意义的表示，能够从有限数据中更有效地泛化。在83%的情况下，通过引导预测潜在变量能够产生比单独使用ESM2设计更高的适应性变体。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器为数据稀缺情况下的蛋白质功能预测和设计提供了有效的解决方案，其稀疏潜在表示能够更好地捕捉生物学特征并实现更有效的泛化。

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

TL;DR: DrugReasoner是基于LLaMA架构的推理大语言模型，通过GRPO微调预测小分子药物批准概率，整合分子描述符和结构相似性比较推理，在预测准确性和可解释性方面均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现过程复杂且资源密集，需要早期预测批准结果以优化研发投资。现有机器学习方法虽然有效但可解释性有限，限制了其实际影响力。

Method: 基于LLaMA架构构建DrugReasoner模型，使用GRPO进行微调，整合分子描述符和与结构相似化合物的比较推理，生成预测结果的同时提供逐步推理过程和置信度评分。

Result: 在验证集上AUC为0.732，F1分数0.729；测试集上AUC 0.725，F1分数0.718，优于逻辑回归、SVM、KNN等传统方法，与XGBoost竞争。在外部独立数据集上AUC 0.728，F1分数0.774，优于基准方法和ChemAP模型。

Conclusion: DrugReasoner不仅提供竞争性的预测准确性，还通过推理输出增强透明度，解决了AI辅助药物发现中的关键瓶颈，展示了推理增强LLM作为可解释有效药物决策工具的潜力。

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

*Ifrah Tariq,Ernest Fraenkel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BDVAE是一种生物解缠变分自编码器，通过整合多组学数据和模块化编码器架构，准确预测免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应并揭示耐药机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 免疫检查点抑制剂治疗效果存在显著个体差异，现有机器学习模型缺乏可解释性且未能充分利用多组学数据的生物结构信息。

Method: 开发BDVAE深度生成模型，使用模态和通路特异性编码器整合转录组和基因组数据，通过变分推理学习与免疫、基因组和代谢过程相关的生物学意义潜在特征。

Result: 在366名患者的泛癌队列中，BDVAE准确预测治疗反应（测试数据AUC-ROC=0.94），揭示了免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制，发现耐药性呈现连续生物学谱系而非严格二元状态。

Conclusion: BDVAE证明了生物结构化机器学习在阐明复杂耐药模式和指导精准免疫治疗策略方面的价值，能够生成可解释且临床相关的见解。

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

TL;DR: BDVAE是一种深度生成模型，整合转录组和基因组数据，通过模态和通路特异性编码器学习生物学意义的潜在特征，准确预测免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应并揭示耐药机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应存在高度变异性，现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性且未能有效利用多组学数据的生物学结构。

Method: 开发了生物学解缠变分自编码器(BDVAE)，采用模块化编码器架构和变分推断，整合转录组和基因组数据，学习与免疫、基因组和代谢过程相关的生物学意义潜在特征。

Result: 在366名患者的泛癌队列中，BDVAE准确预测治疗反应(AUC-ROC=0.94)，揭示了免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制，发现耐药性呈现连续生物学谱系而非严格二元状态。

Conclusion: BDVAE能够生成可解释的临床相关见解，证明了生物学结构化机器学习在阐明复杂耐药模式和指导精准免疫治疗策略方面的价值。

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Motivation: 系统生物学模型的可靠预测需要了解参数是否可以从可用数据中估计以及估计的确定性。可识别性分析对于确定参数是否可学习至关重要。

Method: 使用线性模型介绍核心概念，强调实验设计和输出敏感性如何影响可识别性。在非线性模型中，采用全局和基于模拟的方法。总结了评估可识别性的计算方法。

Result: 弱可识别参数可能破坏超出校准数据集的预测。提出了改善可识别性的策略，包括测量不同输出、改进模型结构和添加先验知识。

Conclusion: 可识别性决定了推断和预测的极限。认识和解决可识别性问题对于构建不仅与数据拟合良好，而且能够提供具有稳健、可量化不确定性预测的模型至关重要。

Abstract: Reliable predictions from systems biology models require knowing whether
parameters can be estimated from available data, and with what certainty.
Identifiability analysis reveals whether parameters are learnable in principle
(structural identifiability) and in practice (practical identifiability). We
introduce the core ideas using linear models, highlighting how experimental
design and output sensitivity shape identifiability. In nonlinear models,
identifiability can vary with parameter values, motivating global and
simulation-based approaches. We summarise computational methods for assessing
identifiability noting that weakly identifiable parameters can undermine
predictions beyond the calibration dataset. Strategies to improve
identifiability include measuring different outputs, refining model structure,
and adding prior knowledge. Far from a technical afterthought, identifiability
determines the limits of inference and prediction. Recognising and addressing
identifiability is essential for building models that are not only well-fitted
to data, but also capable of delivering predictions with robust, quantifiable
uncertainty.

### [17] [Saccade crossing avoidance as a visual search strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18404)
*Alex Szorkovszky,Rujeena Mathema,Pedro Lencastre,Pedro Lind,Anis Yazidi*

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉搜索中存在一种新的记忆依赖性效应——自我交叉回避，即眼跳会避免与早期扫描路径交叉，这种效应在个体间差异显著且最强影响来自约7秒内的路径历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉搜索看似随机，但存在多种眼动偏差，其中较长路径历史的影响难以量化。研究旨在探索视觉搜索中基于记忆的眼动模式。

Method: 使用运动生态学中的步选择框架，分析45秒"寻找威利"任务数据，比较真实数据与无记忆空间统计模型生成的合成数据，并通过最大似然拟合和参数化概率模型进行验证。

Result: 发现自我交叉回避效应，效应大小与已知的历史依赖性（如返回抑制）相当。高回避倾向的参与者表现出更小的眼跳长度和更短的注视持续时间。

Conclusion: 交叉回避是一种局部定向策略，有助于促进和补充返回抑制，从而促进视觉场景的探索。

Abstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases
exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the
previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the
longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection
framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second
viewings of "Where's Waldo"?, we report a new memory-dependent effect that also
varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing
avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in
the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show
this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless
approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model
with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood
fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last
$\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known
forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric
probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to
reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also
quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six
images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants
with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and
shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal,
vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that
the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and
complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.
