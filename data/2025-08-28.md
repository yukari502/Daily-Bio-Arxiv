  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞调控系统研究中产生的定性数据往往被忽略或临时处理，缺乏系统性和可重复性，需要开发正式的方法来充分利用这些数据

Method: 使用PyBioNetFit软件包，将定性观察转化为形式化陈述，采用系统化、自动化的参数化方法，结合定性和定量数据进行模型参数估计

Result: PyBioNetFit能够有效利用定性数据和定量数据共同进行系统生物学模型的参数化，并实现不确定性量化

Conclusion: 该方法提高了模型参数估计的可靠性，增强了研究的可重复性，对细胞调控系统研究具有重要意义

Abstract: Data generated in studies of cellular regulatory systems are often
qualitative. For example, measurements of signaling readouts in the presence
and absence of mutations may reveal a rank ordering of responses across
conditions but not the precise extents of mutation-induced differences.
Qualitative data are often ignored by mathematical modelers or are considered
in an ad hoc manner, as in the study of Kocieniewski and Lipniacki (2013) [Phys
Biol 10: 035006], which was focused on the roles of MEK isoforms in ERK
activation. In this earlier study, model parameter values were tuned manually
to obtain consistency with a combination of qualitative and quantitative data.
This approach is not reproducible, nor does it provide insights into parametric
or prediction uncertainties. Here, starting from the same data and the same
ordinary differential equation (ODE) model structure, we generate formalized
statements of qualitative observations, making these observations more
reusable, and we improve the model parameterization procedure by applying a
systematic and automated approach enabled by the software package PyBioNetFit.
We also demonstrate uncertainty quantification (UQ), which was absent in the
original study. Our results show that PyBioNetFit enables qualitative data to
be leveraged, together with quantitative data, in parameterization of systems
biology models and facilitates UQ. These capabilities are important for
reliable estimation of model parameters and model analyses in studies of
cellular regulatory systems and reproducibility.

TL;DR: EAGLE-Net是一个结构保持的注意力引导多实例学习框架，通过整合多尺度空间编码和局部微环境关注机制，在计算病理学中显著提升了分类准确性和生存预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基础模型在计算病理学中缺乏利用组织全局空间结构和局部诊断相关区域上下文关系的机制，而这些对于理解肿瘤微环境至关重要。

Method: 提出EAGLE-Net架构，整合多尺度绝对空间编码捕获全局组织结构，使用top-K邻域感知损失关注局部微环境，并通过背景抑制损失减少假阳性。

Result: 在大型泛癌数据集上，EAGLE-Net实现了高达3%的分类准确率提升，在7种癌症类型中的6种获得最高一致性指数，生成平滑且生物学一致的注意力图。

Conclusion: EAGLE-Net作为一个通用可解释框架，补充了基础模型，能够改善生物标志物发现、预后建模和临床决策支持。

Abstract: Foundation models have recently emerged as powerful feature extractors in
computational pathology, yet they typically omit mechanisms for leveraging the
global spatial structure of tissues and the local contextual relationships
among diagnostically relevant regions - key elements for understanding the
tumor microenvironment. Multiple instance learning (MIL) remains an essential
next step following foundation model, designing a framework to aggregate
patch-level features into slide-level predictions. We present EAGLE-Net, a
structure-preserving, attention-guided MIL architecture designed to augment
prediction and interpretability. EAGLE-Net integrates multi-scale absolute
spatial encoding to capture global tissue architecture, a top-K
neighborhood-aware loss to focus attention on local microenvironments, and
background suppression loss to minimize false positives. We benchmarked
EAGLE-Net on large pan-cancer datasets, including three cancer types for
classification (10,260 slides) and seven cancer types for survival prediction
(4,172 slides), using three distinct histology foundation backbones (REMEDIES,
Uni-V1, Uni2-h). Across tasks, EAGLE-Net achieved up to 3% higher
classification accuracy and the top concordance indices in 6 of 7 cancer types,
producing smooth, biologically coherent attention maps that aligned with expert
annotations and highlighted invasive fronts, necrosis, and immune infiltration.
These results position EAGLE-Net as a generalizable, interpretable framework
that complements foundation models, enabling improved biomarker discovery,
prognostic modeling, and clinical decision support
