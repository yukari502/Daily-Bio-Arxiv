Abstract: CRISPR-based genome editing has revolutionized biotechnology, yet optimizing
guide RNA (gRNA) design for efficiency and safety remains a critical challenge.
Recent advances (2020--2025, updated to reflect current year if needed)
demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, can
markedly improve the prediction of gRNA on-target activity and identify
off-target risks. In parallel, emerging explainable AI (XAI) techniques are
beginning to illuminate the black-box nature of these models, offering insights
into sequence features and genomic contexts that drive Cas enzyme performance.
Here we review how state-of-the-art machine learning models are enhancing gRNA
design for CRISPR systems, highlight strategies for interpreting model
predictions, and discuss new developments in off-target prediction and safety
assessment. We emphasize breakthroughs from top-tier journals that underscore
an interdisciplinary convergence of AI and genome editing to enable more
efficient, specific, and clinically viable CRISPR applications.

Abstract: As the global population continues to age, there is an increasing demand for
ways to accurately quantify the biological processes underlying aging.
Biological age, unlike chronological age, reflects an individual's
physiological state, offering a more accurate measure of health-span and
age-related decline. Aging is a complex, multisystem process involving
molecular, cellular, and environmental factors and can be quantified using
various biophysical and biochemical markers. This review focuses on four key
biochemical markers that have recently been identified by experts as important
outcome measures in longevity-promoting interventions: C-Reactive Protein,
Insulin like Growth Factor-1, Interleukin-6, and Growth Differentiation
Factor-15. With the use of Artificial Intelligence, the analysis and
integration of these biomarkers can be significantly enhanced, enabling the
identification of complex binding patterns and improving predictive accuracy
for biological age estimation and age-related disease risk stratification.
Artificial intelligence-driven methods including machine learning, deep
learning, and multimodal data integration, facilitate the interpretation of
high dimensional datasets and support the development of widely accessible,
data-informed tools for health monitoring and disease risk assessment. This
paves the way for a future medical system, enabling more personalized and
accessible care, offering deeper, data-driven insights into individual health
trajectories, risk profiles, and treatment response. The review additionally
highlights the key challenges, and future directions for the implementation of
artificial intelligence-driven methods in precision aging frameworks.

### [3] [Velocity Spectrum Imaging using velocity encoding preparation pulses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20218)
*Luis Hernandez-Garcia,Alberto L. Vazquez,Doug C. Noll*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非侵入性MRI技术，通过改进的速度选择性射频脉冲和傅里叶变换，能够在每个体素内测量水的三维速度矢量分布，类似于扩散张量成像但针对对流流动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人体内水的运动包含扩散和对流两种物理机制，现有技术只能测量体素内的平均速度，无法获得速度分布信息。需要开发能够测量每个体素内速度分布的技术来研究复杂的流体动力学现象。

Method: 使用改进的速度选择性射频脉冲进行速度编码（类似于k空间编码），然后通过傅里叶变换解码获得速度分布。这种方法无需对比剂，完全非侵入。

Result: 在已知流动特性的简单流动模型上验证了该技术，并在人类参与者身上成功收集了沿三个实验室轴的速度分布数据。

Conclusion: 该技术不仅可用于验证计算流体动力学模型，还是研究glymphatic系统中水复杂运动及其在神经退行性疾病中作用的强大工具。

Abstract: The movement of water in the human body is a very complex phenomenon
encompassing both diffusion and convection. These different physical principles
coexist within the same voxel with dominant sub-mechanisms within different
intra-voxel structures. While diffusion imaging techniques can separate
diffusion populations, convective flow imaging techniques usually measure an
average velocity over the voxel. In this article, we present, test and
implement a new technique to measure the velocity distribution of water inside
each voxel of an MR image. This approach is completely non-invasive and
requires no contrast agents. Modified velocity-selective RF pulses can be used
to encode velocity information analogously to k-space encoding. The velocity
distribution can then be decoded via the Fourier transform. This approach
yields a three-dimensional velocity vector distribution of convective flow in
each voxel, analogously to Diffusion Tensor Imaging. We present the theoretical
principles of this technique, and demonstrates its use on a simple flow phantom
with known flow characteristics. We also demonstrate the technique on human
participants used to collect the velocity distribution along the three
laboratory axes, and discusses its challenges and potential applications. In
addition to a useful tool for validating computational fluid dynamic models in
vivo, velocity spectrum imaging can be a powerful tool to study the complex
movement of water in the glymphatic system and its involvement in
neurodegenerative disorders.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个机制性种群模型来研究细菌生物膜在捕食压力下的形成动态，使用最大似然估计和遗传算法优化数据收集，并通过敏感性分析简化模型。扩展模型还研究了长期行为和进化选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未考虑估计模型参数所需的数据要求，以及细菌在自然栖息地中对重复应激源的反应。需要开发更实用的模型来理解生物膜形成的动态和进化选择。

Method: 采用机制性种群模型，使用最大似然估计框架测量关键参数，遗传算法优化数据收集计划，敏感性分析简化绑定动力学和生物膜分离过程。扩展模型包含不同生物膜形成速率的亚群。

Result: 研究发现可以简化绑定动力学并消除生物膜分离。在不同捕食类型和数量下比较了选择过程，并通过敏感性分析确定了影响选择速度的关键参数。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个实用的建模框架，能够更好地理解细菌生物膜在压力环境下的形成动态和进化适应机制，为实验室和自然环境中的生物膜研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Bacteria often develop distinct phenotypes to adapt to environmental stress.
In particular, they can produce biofilms, dense communities of bacteria that
live in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacterial biofilms provide a safe haven
from environmental conditions by distributing metabolic workload and allowing
them to perform complex multicellular processes. While previous studies have
investigated how bacterial biofilms are regulated under laboratory conditions,
they have not considered (1) the data requirements necessary to estimate model
parameters and (2) how bacteria respond to recurring stressors in their natural
habitats. To address (1), we adapted a mechanistic population model to explore
the dynamics of biofilm formation in the presence of predator stress, using
synthetic data. We used a Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework to measure
crucial parameters underpinning the biofilm formation dynamics. We used genetic
algorithms to propose an optimal data collection schedule that minimised
parameter identifiability confidence interval widths. Our sensitivity analysis
revealed that we could simplify the binding dynamics and eliminate biofilm
detachment. To address (2), we proposed a structured version of our model to
capture the long-term behaviour and evolutionary selection. In our extended
model, the subpopulations feature different maximal rates of biofilm formation.
We compared the selection under different predator types and amounts and
identified key parameters that affected the speed of selection via sensitivity
analysis.

### [5] [Prediction of Distant Metastasis for Head and Neck Cancer Patients Using Multi-Modal Tumor and Peritumoral Feature Fusion Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20469)
*Zizhao Tang,Changhao Liu,Nuo Tong,Shuiping Gou,Mei Shi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发基于深度学习的多模态框架，整合CT影像、放射组学和临床数据来预测头颈部鳞状细胞癌转移风险，性能优于单模态模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈部鳞状细胞癌转移是临床管理的主要挑战，需要可靠的治疗前转移风险预测来优化治疗策略和预后

Method: 使用3D Swin Transformer从肿瘤区域提取深度特征，结合放射组学特征（经相关性过滤和随机森林选择后保留36个特征）和临床变量，通过全连接网络预测转移风险

Result: 多模态融合模型AUC达到0.803，准确率0.752，敏感性0.730，特异性0.758，优于单模态模型（3D深度学习模块单独AUC为0.715）

Conclusion: 该多模态融合模型在预测HNSCC转移风险方面表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，可作为临床决策支持工具用于个性化治疗规划

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

### [6] [Modelling birdsong transmission with methods from molecular sequence analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20833)
*Anthony Kwong,Mark Muldoon*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个新颖的马尔可夫模型来研究爪哇雀的歌曲传播，使用IPLA算法进行拟合，但模型预测能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究鸟类歌曲传播机制，特别是爪哇雀从成年导师学习歌曲的过程，通过建立数学模型来理解这种文化传播现象。

Method: 开发了基于生物序列分析类比的新型马尔可夫模型，使用Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm (IPLA)算法对爪哇雀歌曲数据进行拟合。

Result: 模型对爪哇雀歌曲传播相关自然问题的预测能力有限，主要原因是歌曲学习的忠实性和歌曲长度较短。

Conclusion: 虽然建立了新颖的数学模型，但由于物种特异性因素（学习忠实性和歌曲简短性），该模型在爪哇雀歌曲传播研究中的应用效果不佳。

Abstract: In many species of songbirds, juvenile males learn their songs from adult
male tutors. In this paper we formulate a novel Markov model for birdsong
transmission developed by analogy with models used in biological sequence
analysis. We fit the model using the recently developed Interacting Particle
Langevin Algorithm (IPLA) of Akyildiz et al. (arXiv:2303.13429) and analyse a
collection of songs from Java sparrows (Lonchura oryzivora) originally recorded
and studied by Masayo Soma and her collaborators. The model proves to have
limited predictive power for a number of natural problems associated with song
transmission in Java sparrows and we propose reasons for this, including the
well-established faithfulness of song-learning and the comparative brevity of
Java sparrow songs.

### [7] [Practical indistinguishability in a gene regulatory network inference problem, a case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21006)
*Cody E. FitzGerald,Shelley Reich,Victor Agaba,Arjun Mathur,Michael S. Werner,Niall M. Mangan*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 本文通过元分析发现生物系统建模中存在大量模型结构不确定性，并通过线虫发育调控网络的案例研究，从13,824个模型中识别出数据支持的最佳调控特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物数据通常存在噪声、测量限制和状态不完整性，导致模型开发中存在结构不确定性，需要系统分析不同模型结构的比较和选择。

Method: 采用元分析方法分析六个数学生物学期刊，并通过线虫Pristonchus pacificus发育调控网络的实际案例，比较13,824个不同调控网络结构模型。

Result: 发现每个实验条件下的最佳拟合模型共享特征组合，识别出跨条件的共同调控网络，该网络显示关键调控因子eud-1、sult-1和nhr-40之间存在高度正调控和互连性。

Conclusion: 虽然生物学结果特定于该线虫的发育分子生物学，但所面临的建模框架和挑战在生物学、化学、物理学等众多科学领域中普遍存在。

Abstract: Computationally inferring mechanistic insights from typical biological data
is a challenging pursuit. Even the highest-quality experimental data come with
challenges. There are always sources of noise, a limit to how often we can
measure the system, and we can rarely measure all the relevant states that
participate in the underlying complexity. There are usually sources of
uncertainty in model development, which give rise to multiple competing model
structures. To underscore the need for further analysis of structural
uncertainty in modeling, we use a meta-analysis across six journals covering
mathematical biology and show that a huge number of models for biological
systems are developed each year, but model selection and comparison across
model structures appear to be less common. We walk through a case study
involving inference of regulatory network structure involved in a developmental
decision in the nematode, \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}. We use real
biological data and compare across 13,824 models--each corresponding to a
different regulatory network structure, to determine which regulatory features
are supported by the data across three experimental conditions. We find that
the best-fitting models for each experimental condition share a combination of
features and identify a regulatory network that is common across the model sets
for each condition. This model can describe the data across the experimental
conditions we considered and exhibits a high degree of positive regulation and
interconnectivity between the key regulators, \textit{eud-1}, $textit{sult-1},
and \textit{nhr-40}. While the biological results are specific to the molecular
biology of development in \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}, the general modeling
framework and underlying challenges we faced doing this analysis are widespread
across biology, chemistry, physics, and many other scientific disciplines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了172项研究，发现基于Transformer的大语言模型在遗传病诊断中显著提升了变异识别、医学影像分析和报告生成能力，但在多模态数据整合和临床落地方面仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法和机器学习在处理复杂高维遗传数据时存在局限，需要评估大语言模型在遗传研究和疾病诊断中的最新应用进展。

Method: 通过PubMed、bioRxiv、medRxiv和arXiv的自动化关键词搜索，筛选并分析了172项关于LLM在遗传学诊断和教育中应用的研究。

Result: 研究发现Transformer模型在疾病风险分层、变异解释、医学影像分析和报告生成方面取得显著进展，但在多模态数据整合和临床通用性方面存在限制。

Conclusion: 大语言模型正在改变遗传病诊断格局，但需要解决多模态数据整合和临床实施的实际挑战，本综述为该快速发展的领域提供了分类和评估指南。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Conclusion: 该模型满足了临床计算前列腺特定亚体积中肿瘤受累概率的重要需求，这对放射治疗规划和其他应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative
growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic
imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor
spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding
small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move,
duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that
captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical
specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively
describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in
prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape,
correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as
a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the
probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which
is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.
