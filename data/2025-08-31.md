Abstract: CRISPR-based genome editing has revolutionized biotechnology, yet optimizing
guide RNA (gRNA) design for efficiency and safety remains a critical challenge.
Recent advances (2020--2025, updated to reflect current year if needed)
demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, can
markedly improve the prediction of gRNA on-target activity and identify
off-target risks. In parallel, emerging explainable AI (XAI) techniques are
beginning to illuminate the black-box nature of these models, offering insights
into sequence features and genomic contexts that drive Cas enzyme performance.
Here we review how state-of-the-art machine learning models are enhancing gRNA
design for CRISPR systems, highlight strategies for interpreting model
predictions, and discuss new developments in off-target prediction and safety
assessment. We emphasize breakthroughs from top-tier journals that underscore
an interdisciplinary convergence of AI and genome editing to enable more
efficient, specific, and clinically viable CRISPR applications.

### [2] [Biomarker Integration and Biosensor Technologies Enabling AI-Driven Insights into Biological Aging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20150)
*Jared A Kushner,Mohit Pandey,Sandeep,S Kohli*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文综述了利用人工智能分析四种关键生物标志物（CRP、IGF-1、IL-6、GDF-15）来量化生物年龄和评估衰老相关疾病风险的方法，旨在推动精准老龄化医疗的发展。

Abstract: As the global population continues to age, there is an increasing demand for
ways to accurately quantify the biological processes underlying aging.
Biological age, unlike chronological age, reflects an individual's
physiological state, offering a more accurate measure of health-span and
age-related decline. Aging is a complex, multisystem process involving
molecular, cellular, and environmental factors and can be quantified using
various biophysical and biochemical markers. This review focuses on four key
biochemical markers that have recently been identified by experts as important
outcome measures in longevity-promoting interventions: C-Reactive Protein,
Insulin like Growth Factor-1, Interleukin-6, and Growth Differentiation
Factor-15. With the use of Artificial Intelligence, the analysis and
integration of these biomarkers can be significantly enhanced, enabling the
identification of complex binding patterns and improving predictive accuracy
for biological age estimation and age-related disease risk stratification.
Artificial intelligence-driven methods including machine learning, deep
learning, and multimodal data integration, facilitate the interpretation of
high dimensional datasets and support the development of widely accessible,
data-informed tools for health monitoring and disease risk assessment. This
paves the way for a future medical system, enabling more personalized and
accessible care, offering deeper, data-driven insights into individual health
trajectories, risk profiles, and treatment response. The review additionally
highlights the key challenges, and future directions for the implementation of
artificial intelligence-driven methods in precision aging frameworks.

### [3] [Velocity Spectrum Imaging using velocity encoding preparation pulses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20218)
*Luis Hernandez-Garcia,Alberto L. Vazquez,Doug C. Noll*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出一种新的非侵入性MRI技术，通过改进的速度选择性射频脉冲和傅里叶变换编码，可在每个体素内测量水的三维速度矢量分布，类似于扩散张量成像但对流速度分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人体内水运动是复杂现象，包含扩散和对流。现有技术只能测量体素内的平均速度，无法获得速度分布信息。需要开发能够测量每个体素内速度分布的非侵入性方法。

Method: 使用改进的速度选择性射频脉冲进行速度编码，类似于k空间编码原理，然后通过傅里叶变换解码获得速度分布。该方法无需对比剂，完全非侵入。

Result: 在已知流动特性的简单流动模型上验证了技术有效性，并在人类参与者身上成功收集了三个实验室轴的速度分布数据。

Conclusion: 该技术是验证计算流体动力学模型的有用工具，也是研究glymphatic系统中水复杂运动及其在神经退行性疾病中作用的强大工具。

Abstract: The movement of water in the human body is a very complex phenomenon
encompassing both diffusion and convection. These different physical principles
coexist within the same voxel with dominant sub-mechanisms within different
intra-voxel structures. While diffusion imaging techniques can separate
diffusion populations, convective flow imaging techniques usually measure an
average velocity over the voxel. In this article, we present, test and
implement a new technique to measure the velocity distribution of water inside
each voxel of an MR image. This approach is completely non-invasive and
requires no contrast agents. Modified velocity-selective RF pulses can be used
to encode velocity information analogously to k-space encoding. The velocity
distribution can then be decoded via the Fourier transform. This approach
yields a three-dimensional velocity vector distribution of convective flow in
each voxel, analogously to Diffusion Tensor Imaging. We present the theoretical
principles of this technique, and demonstrates its use on a simple flow phantom
with known flow characteristics. We also demonstrate the technique on human
participants used to collect the velocity distribution along the three
laboratory axes, and discusses its challenges and potential applications. In
addition to a useful tool for validating computational fluid dynamic models in
vivo, velocity spectrum imaging can be a powerful tool to study the complex
movement of water in the glymphatic system and its involvement in
neurodegenerative disorders.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了实用的建模框架来分析细菌生物膜形成动态，解决了参数估计的数据需求问题，并揭示了在重复捕食压力下的长期进化选择机制，为理解细菌适应性策略提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Bacteria often develop distinct phenotypes to adapt to environmental stress.
In particular, they can produce biofilms, dense communities of bacteria that
live in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacterial biofilms provide a safe haven
from environmental conditions by distributing metabolic workload and allowing
them to perform complex multicellular processes. While previous studies have
investigated how bacterial biofilms are regulated under laboratory conditions,
they have not considered (1) the data requirements necessary to estimate model
parameters and (2) how bacteria respond to recurring stressors in their natural
habitats. To address (1), we adapted a mechanistic population model to explore
the dynamics of biofilm formation in the presence of predator stress, using
synthetic data. We used a Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework to measure
crucial parameters underpinning the biofilm formation dynamics. We used genetic
algorithms to propose an optimal data collection schedule that minimised
parameter identifiability confidence interval widths. Our sensitivity analysis
revealed that we could simplify the binding dynamics and eliminate biofilm
detachment. To address (2), we proposed a structured version of our model to
capture the long-term behaviour and evolutionary selection. In our extended
model, the subpopulations feature different maximal rates of biofilm formation.
We compared the selection under different predator types and amounts and
identified key parameters that affected the speed of selection via sensitivity
analysis.

### [5] [Prediction of Distant Metastasis for Head and Neck Cancer Patients Using Multi-Modal Tumor and Peritumoral Feature Fusion Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20469)
*Zizhao Tang,Changhao Liu,Nuo Tong,Shuiping Gou,Mei Shi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 基于3D Swin Transformer的多模态深度学习框架，统合CT图像、收兜组学和临床数据，准确预测头颈鱼相细胞瘤转移风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 转移是头颈鱼相细胞瘤临床管理的主要挑战，需要可靠的治疗前转移风险预测来优化治疗策略和预后

Method: 整合1497名患者数据，使用3D Swin Transformer从肿瘤区域提取深度特征，PyRadiomics提取1562个收兜组学特征（经过筛选后留下36个），结合临床变量，通过全连接网络进行多模态融合预测

Result: 多模态融合模型表现最佳（AUC=0.803，准确度=0.752，敏感度=0.730，特异度=0.758），显著超过单一模态模型，在不同肿瘤子型中都保持良好的通用性

Conclusion: 该多模态融合模型能够准确预测HNSCC转移风险，为临床决策提供了可解释的工具，有助于个性化治疗方案的制定

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

### [6] [Modelling birdsong transmission with methods from molecular sequence analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20833)
*Anthony Kwong,Mark Muldoon*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新颖的马尔可夫模型用于分析鸟类歌曲传播，使用IPLA算法拟合Java麻雀的歌曲数据，但模型预测能力有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究鸟类歌曲传播机制，特别是幼年雄性鸟类如何从成年导师那里学习歌曲，希望通过数学模型来理解这一过程

Method: 开发了基于生物序列分析类比的新型马尔可夫模型，使用Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm (IPLA)算法对Java麻雀的歌曲数据进行拟合

Result: 模型对Java麻雀歌曲传播相关自然问题的预测能力有限，这可能与歌曲学习的忠实性和歌曲相对简短有关

Conclusion: 虽然模型构建成功，但由于鸟类歌曲学习的特殊性和歌曲结构特点，马尔可夫模型在预测歌曲传播方面的应用存在局限性

Abstract: In many species of songbirds, juvenile males learn their songs from adult
male tutors. In this paper we formulate a novel Markov model for birdsong
transmission developed by analogy with models used in biological sequence
analysis. We fit the model using the recently developed Interacting Particle
Langevin Algorithm (IPLA) of Akyildiz et al. (arXiv:2303.13429) and analyse a
collection of songs from Java sparrows (Lonchura oryzivora) originally recorded
and studied by Masayo Soma and her collaborators. The model proves to have
limited predictive power for a number of natural problems associated with song
transmission in Java sparrows and we propose reasons for this, including the
well-established faithfulness of song-learning and the comparative brevity of
Java sparrow songs.

Abstract: Computationally inferring mechanistic insights from typical biological data
is a challenging pursuit. Even the highest-quality experimental data come with
challenges. There are always sources of noise, a limit to how often we can
measure the system, and we can rarely measure all the relevant states that
participate in the underlying complexity. There are usually sources of
uncertainty in model development, which give rise to multiple competing model
structures. To underscore the need for further analysis of structural
uncertainty in modeling, we use a meta-analysis across six journals covering
mathematical biology and show that a huge number of models for biological
systems are developed each year, but model selection and comparison across
model structures appear to be less common. We walk through a case study
involving inference of regulatory network structure involved in a developmental
decision in the nematode, \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}. We use real
biological data and compare across 13,824 models--each corresponding to a
different regulatory network structure, to determine which regulatory features
are supported by the data across three experimental conditions. We find that
the best-fitting models for each experimental condition share a combination of
features and identify a regulatory network that is common across the model sets
for each condition. This model can describe the data across the experimental
conditions we considered and exhibits a high degree of positive regulation and
interconnectivity between the key regulators, \textit{eud-1}, $textit{sult-1},
and \textit{nhr-40}. While the biological results are specific to the molecular
biology of development in \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}, the general modeling
framework and underlying challenges we faced doing this analysis are widespread
across biology, chemistry, physics, and many other scientific disciplines.

Conclusion: 这种简洁的物理模型能够准确地描述前列腺癌的形态学特征，通过Ising相互作用实现表面张力效果，为攽疗计划提供了重要的临床应用价值

Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative
growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic
imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor
spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding
small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move,
duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that
captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical
specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively
describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in
prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape,
correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as
a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the
probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which
is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.

Result: 研究发现transformer模型在疾病风险分层、变异解释、医学影像分析和报告生成方面取得显著进展，但在多模态数据整合（基因组序列、影像和临床记录）方面仍面临通用性和临床实施的重大挑战。

Conclusion: 该综述全面分类和评估了LLM在遗传疾病诊断转型和教育支持中的当前能力和局限性，为这一快速发展领域提供了导航指南，强调了从理论研究向临床实践转化的重要性。

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.
