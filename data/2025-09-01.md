TL;DR: ImmunoAI是一个机器学习框架，通过梯度提升模型预测高亲和力抗体，将抗体发现时间从10-12个月大幅缩短，搜索空间减少89%，并成功识别出针对hMPV病毒的高效抗体候选物。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗体发现流程需要10-12个月，无法满足快速应对病毒爆发的需求。hMPV病毒对儿童、老年人和免疫功能低下人群构成严重威胁，急需加速抗体发现过程。

Method: 使用213个抗体-抗原复合物数据集提取几何和物理化学特征，训练LightGBM回归器预测结合亲和力。针对hMPV A2.2变体使用AlphaFold2预测3D结构，并通过在117个SARS-CoV-2结合对上微调模型。

Result: 模型将抗体候选物搜索空间减少89%，RMSE从1.70降低到0.92。成功识别出两个针对关键突变位点(G42V和E96K)的皮摩尔级亲和力抗体候选物。

Conclusion: ImmunoAI显著缩短了设计周期，能够实现更快、基于结构信息的病毒爆发应对，为快速抗体发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and
immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require
10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This
project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates
antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using
gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D
topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes
was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM
regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The
model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on
117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2
variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model
identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting
key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for
experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables
faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.

Conclusion: 民学习数字双胞模型的进步需要混合框架，结合化学反应网络机制基础、贝叶斯不确定性量化以及深度学习的生成能力和知识集成能力。需要建立基准测试框架来评估各种方法。

Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of
high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital
twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key
reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug
discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on
laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches
are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,
rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest
in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.
Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from
biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We
evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological
challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior
knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved
variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.
Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic
regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight
the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable
innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency
of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all
challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from
hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based
mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative
and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their
development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods
across all challenges.

### [3] [Mutual Information Rate -- Linear Noise Approximation and Exact Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21220)
*Manuel Reinhardt,Age J. Tjalma,Anne-Lena Moor,Christoph Zechner,Pieter Rein ten Wolde*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 评估高斯近似在非高斯系统中估计互信息率的准确性，发现在离散线性系统和连续非线性系统中都存在显著偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息率是量化动态系统信息流的核心概念，高斯近似是常用的估计方法但仅限于线性系统，其在非线性或离散系统中的准确性尚不清楚

Method: 使用路径权重采样(PWS)技术精确计算互信息率，通过两个案例研究评估高斯近似的局限性：离散线性系统和连续非线性扩散系统

Result: 即使在统计特性接近高斯的离散线性系统中，高斯近似也无法准确估计互信息率；在非线性系统中，随着非线性程度增加，高斯近似与精确值的偏差显著增大

Conclusion: 高斯近似在不同随机模型中的性能存在局限性，当需要精确估计互信息率时，需要采用计算强度更大的方法如PWS

Abstract: Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and
engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information
theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of
input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in
dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate
is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output
trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to
linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains
unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for
non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent
technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case
studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we
focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's
statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately
estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive
system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations
between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as
nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the
Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and
highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are
necessary.

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: 该论文研究了显示多个系统发育树所需的最小网络复杂度，证明了对于t个叶子数为n的树，在某些情况下需要接近(t-1)n个网状结构，匹配了已知的上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多个系统发育树在网络中显示时所需的最小网状结构数量，探索树间共同结构对网络复杂度的影响。

Method: 使用计数论证方法，构造具有极少共同结构的树集合，证明任何显示这些树的网络都需要大量网状结构。

Result: 对于t ∈ o(√lg n)个树，存在需要(t-1)n - o(n)个网状结构的树集合；对于t = c lg n，需要Ω(n lg n)个网状结构，匹配已知上界。

Conclusion: 多个系统发育树的网络显示需要大量网状结构，特别是在树间缺乏共同结构时，结果扩展到了无根网络和树的情况。

Abstract: It is known that any two trees on the same $n$ leaves can be displayed by a
network with $n-2$ reticulations, and there are two trees that cannot be
displayed by a network with fewer reticulations. But how many reticulations are
needed to display multiple trees? For any set of $t$ trees on $n$ leaves, there
is a trivial network with $(t - 1)n$ reticulations that displays them. To do
better, we have to exploit common structure of the trees to embed non-trivial
subtrees of different trees into the same part of the network. In this paper,
we show that for $t \in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there is a set of $t$ trees with
virtually no common structure that could be exploited. More precisely, we show
for any $t\in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there are $t$ trees such that any network
displaying them has $(t-1)n - o(n)$ reticulations. For $t \in o(\lg n)$, we
obtain a slightly weaker bound. We also prove that already for $t = c\lg n$,
for any constant $c > 0$, there is a set of $t$ trees that cannot be displayed
by a network with $o(n \lg n)$ reticulations, matching up to constant factors
the known upper bound of $O(n \lg n)$ reticulations sufficient to display
\emph{all} trees with $n$ leaves. These results are based on simple counting
arguments and extend to unrooted networks and trees.
