However, the\ngrowing number of computational tools has created a complex landscape, making\ndirect performance comparison challenging due to inconsistent benchmarks and\nvarying usability. Here, we provide a systematic review and a rigorous\nbenchmark of 27 virus-host prediction tools. We formulate the host prediction\ntask into two primary frameworks, link prediction and multi-class\nclassification, and construct two benchmark datasets to evaluate tool\nperformance in distinct scenarios: a database-centric dataset (RefSeq-VHDB) and\na metagenomic discovery dataset (MetaHiC-VHDB). Our results reveal that no\nsingle tool is universally optimal. Performance is highly context-dependent,\nwith tools like CHERRY and iPHoP demonstrating robust, broad applicability,\nwhile others, such as RaFAH and PHIST, excel in specific contexts. We further\nidentify a critical trade-off between predictive accuracy, prediction rate, and\ncomputational cost. This work serves as a practical guide for researchers and\nestablishes a standardized benchmark to drive future innovation in deciphering\ncomplex virus-host interactions."}
