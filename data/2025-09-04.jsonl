However, the high dimensionality and\ntechnical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical\nchallenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression\nlevels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular\nidentity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding\napproach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven\ngene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG)\nusing random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes,\nwhile simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent\nexpression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an\nEnriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural\nnetwork to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and\ngene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive\nrepresentation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple\ndatasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell\npopulations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering,\nand trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant\nadvance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for\nunderstanding cellular diversity and dynamics."}

In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,\npre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,\nwhich for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,\nwhich are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of\nknown epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of\nepitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to\npredict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus\nnarrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying\nspecific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and\npredictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery.
