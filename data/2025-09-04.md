### [1] [Enhanced Single-Cell RNA-seq Embedding through Gene Expression and Data-Driven Gene-Gene Interaction Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02639)
*Hojjat Torabi Goudarzi,Maziyar Baran Pouyan*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 一种新的单细胞RNA序列数据嵌入方法，通过统合基因表达和基因-基因交互作用，提高了稀有细胞群检测和下游分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单细胞RNA序列嵌入方法主要关注基因表达水平，忽视了关键的基因-基因交互作用，而这些交互作用对于细胞识别和功能至关重要。

Method: 首先使用随机森林模型构建细胞-叶子图(CLG)来捐捉基因间调控关系，同时构建K近邻图(KNNG)表示细胞间表达相似性，然后将两者结合成丰富细胞-叶子图(ECLG)，最后使用图神经网络计算细胞嵌入。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法能够提高稀有细胞群的检测能力，并改善了可视化、聚类和轨迹推断等下游分析的性能。

Conclusion: 这种集成方法代表了单细胞数据分析领域的重要进展，为理解细胞异质性和动态过程提供了更完整的分析框架。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented insights into
cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological
systems at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality and
technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical
challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression
levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular
identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding
approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven
gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG)
using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes,
while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent
expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an
Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural
network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and
gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive
representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple
datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell
populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering,
and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant
advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for
understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.

### [2] [Optimizing Prognostic Biomarker Discovery in Pancreatic Cancer Through Hybrid Ensemble Feature Selection and Multi-Omics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02648)
*John Zobolas,Anne-Marie George,Alberto López,Sebastian Fischer,Marc Becker,Tero Aittokallio*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 开发了一种混合集成特征选择方法hEFS，用于高维多组学数据的生存预测，通过投票机制和帕累托前沿选择最优特征，在胰腺癌数据中表现出更好的稀疏性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维多组学数据生存预测需要系统性的特征选择方法，确保预测性能、稀疏性和可靠性，以发现预后生物标志物。

Method: 结合数据子采样和多种预后模型的混合集成特征选择方法，整合嵌入式与包装式策略，使用投票理论聚合机制对特征排序，通过帕累托前沿平衡预测精度和模型稀疏性来选择最优特征数量。

Result: 在三个胰腺癌队列的多组学数据中，hEFS相比传统的CoxLasso模型识别出更少、更稳定的生物标志物，同时保持相当的判别性能。

Conclusion: hEFS为高维生存环境下的预后建模和生物标志物发现提供了一个稳健、可解释且具有临床价值的工具，已集成到mlr3fselect R包中。

Abstract: Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data
requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive
performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We
developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines
data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and
wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked
using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and
subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto
front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any
user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three
pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable
biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while
maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the
open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and
clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in
high-dimensional survival settings.

TL;DR: DR.INFO临床支持助手在HealthBench基准测试中表现优异，显著超越主流大语言模型和其他RAG助手，展示了在临床场景中的强大能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床评估方法局限于选择题，无法全面评估LLM在复杂高风险临床场景中的情境推理、意识识别和不确定性处理等关键能力

Method: 使用HealthBench基准（基于专家标注的开放式健康对话的评分驱动基准）评估DR.INFO代理式RAG临床支持助手，包含1000个困难样本和100个对比样本

Result: DR.INFO在困难子集上获得0.51分，显著超越GPT-5、o3、Grok 3、GPT-4、Gemini 2.5等前沿模型；在100样本对比中保持领先（0.54分），在沟通、指令遵循和准确性方面表现突出

Conclusion: 基于行为层面的评分驱动评估方法对于构建可靠可信的AI临床支持助手具有重要价值，同时揭示了在情境意识和回答完整性方面仍需改进

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate
high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions
requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems
behave in complex, high-stake clincal scenarios. Traditional evaluations are
often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential
competencies such as contextual reasoning, awareness and uncertainty handling
etc. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic, RAG-based clinical
support assistant, DR.INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark
composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard
subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR.INFO achieves a HealthBench score of
0.51, substantially outperforming leading frontier LLMs (GPT-5, o3, Grok 3,
GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness,
instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against
similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence, Pathway.md), it maintains a
performance lead with a health-bench score of 0.54. These results highlight
DR.INFOs strengths in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while
also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and completeness of a
response. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level,
rubric-based evaluation for building a reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled
clinical support assistant.

### [4] [Lessons Learned from Deploying Adaptive Machine Learning Agents with Limited Data for Real-time Cell Culture Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02606)
*Thanh Tung Khuat,Johnny Peng,Robert Bassett,Ellen Otte,Bogdan Gabrys*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种机器学习方法（预训练模型、即时学习和在线学习）在细胞培养过程中基于拉曼光谱实时预测代谢物浓度的性能，通过两个工业案例研究分析了不同生物工艺条件对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物制造过程中数据有限和工艺变异性带来的挑战，开发能够适应动态变化环境的鲁棒机器学习模型，实现代谢物浓度的实时准确预测。

Method: 使用三种机器学习方法：预训练模型、即时学习(JITL)和在线学习算法，基于拉曼光谱数据预测葡萄糖、乳酸和铵离子浓度。通过两个工业案例研究评估不同生物工艺条件对模型性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现预训练模型在特定条件下表现出更高的预测准确性，而即时学习和在线学习方法在需要自适应过程监控的场景中更有效。研究还证实了混合专家框架在提高预测准确性和鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在生物反应器运行期间使用最新离线分析测量更新模型的重要性，为在动态变化的生物制造环境中有效部署机器学习模型提供了鲁棒策略。混合专家框架能够显著提升基于拉曼光谱数据的代谢物浓度实时预测性能。

Abstract: This study explores the deployment of three machine learning (ML) approaches
for real-time prediction of glucose, lactate, and ammonium concentrations in
cell culture processes, using Raman spectroscopy as input features. The
research addresses challenges associated with limited data availability and
process variability, providing a comparative analysis of pretrained models,
just-in-time learning (JITL), and online learning algorithms. Two industrial
case studies are presented to evaluate the impact of varying bioprocess
conditions on model performance. The findings highlight the specific conditions
under which pretrained models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and
identify scenarios where JITL or online learning approaches are more effective
for adaptive process monitoring. This study also highlights the critical
importance of updating the deployed models/agents with the latest offline
analytical measurements during bioreactor operations to maintain the model
performance against the changes in cell growth behaviours and operating
conditions throughout the bioreactor run. Additionally, the study confirms the
usefulness of a simple mixture-of-experts framework in achieving enhanced
accuracy and robustness for real-time predictions of metabolite concentrations
based on Raman spectral data. These insights contribute to the development of
robust strategies for the efficient deployment of ML models in dynamic and
changing biomanufacturing environments.

### [5] [Resilient Biosecurity in the Era of AI-Enabled Bioweapons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02610)
*Jonathan Feldman,Tal Feldman*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 当前PPI预测工具（AlphaFold 3、AF3Complex、SpatialPPIv2）在检测已知病毒-宿主相互作用方面表现不佳，无法可靠识别生物威胁，需要转向响应导向的基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有生物安全措施的有效性，特别是基于蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测的推理时过滤器，以应对生成生物学带来的新型生物武器风险。

Method: 使用三种领先的PPI预测工具（AlphaFold 3、AF3Complex、SpatialPPIv2）测试已知的病毒-宿主相互作用，包括乙型肝炎和SARS-CoV-2的相互作用。

Result: 这些模型未能检测到大量已知相互作用，特别是无法识别任何经过实验验证的SARS-CoV-2突变体的结合能力，表明现有预测过滤器不可靠。

Conclusion: 需要转向响应导向的基础设施，包括快速实验验证、适应性生物制造和能够跟上AI发展速度的监管框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative biology have enabled the design of novel
proteins, creating significant opportunities for drug discovery while also
introducing new risks, including the potential development of synthetic
bioweapons. Existing biosafety measures primarily rely on inference-time
filters such as sequence alignment and protein-protein interaction (PPI)
prediction to detect dangerous outputs. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of three leading PPI prediction tools: AlphaFold 3, AF3Complex, and
SpatialPPIv2. These models were tested on well-characterized viral-host
interactions, such as those involving Hepatitis B and SARS-CoV-2. Despite being
trained on many of the same viruses, the models fail to detect a substantial
number of known interactions. Strikingly, none of the tools successfully
identify any of the four experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 mutants with
confirmed binding. These findings suggest that current predictive filters are
inadequate for reliably flagging even known biological threats and are even
more unlikely to detect novel ones. We argue for a shift toward
response-oriented infrastructure, including rapid experimental validation,
adaptable biomanufacturing, and regulatory frameworks capable of operating at
the speed of AI-driven developments.

### [6] [A Wrist-Worn Multimodal Reaction Time Monitoring Device for Ecologically-Valid Cognitive Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02626)
*Abhigyan Sarkar,Boris Rubinsky*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发低成本腕戴式反应时间测量设备，可在真实环境中通过听觉、视觉和触觉模态进行毫秒级延迟的认知监测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反应时间测量系统需要用户主动参与和受控环境，限制了在真实世界场景中的应用，需要开发非侵入式的实时监测工具

Method: 设计基于微控制器的紧凑系统，集成同步刺激传递和事件检测，采用硬件架构、时序控制算法和校准方法确保跨模态一致性延迟处理

Result: 6名成人参与的概念验证研究表明，该系统与基准计算机工具在五种实验条件下获得统计可比的反应时间测量结果，具有强大的模态一致性

Conclusion: 该设备为时间关键行为测量提供了经过验证的设计，在无约束环境噪声条件下表现出鲁棒性，为连续实时认知监测提供了强大新工具，具有研究和临床应用潜力

Abstract: Reaction time (RT) is a fundamental measure in cognitive and
neurophysiological assessment, yet most existing RT systems require active user
engagement and controlled environments, limiting their use in real-world
settings. This paper introduces a low cost wrist-worn instrumentation platform
designed to capture human reaction times (RT) across auditory, visual, and
haptic modalities with millisecond latency in real-world conditions. The device
integrates synchronized stimulus delivery and event detection within a compact
microcontroller-based system, eliminating the need for user focus or examiner
supervision. Emphasizing measurement fidelity, we detail the hardware
architecture, timing control algorithms, and calibration methodology used to
ensure consistent latency handling across modalities. A proof-of-concept study
with six adult participants compares this system against a benchmark
computer-based RT tool across five experimental conditions. The results confirm
that the device achieves statistically comparable RT measurements with strong
modality consistency, supporting its potential as a novel tool for
non-obtrusive cognitive monitoring. Contributions include a validated design
for time-critical behavioral measurement and a demonstration of its robustness
in unconstrained, ambient-noise environments. It offers a powerful new tool for
continuous, real-world cognitive monitoring and has significant potential for
both research and clinical applications.

TL;DR: 网络医学框架整合长寿相关基因到人类相互作用组，识别可调节衰老过程的现有药物，发现药物可逆转衰老相关转录变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有数千个基因与年龄相关表型有关，但由于长寿的多因素性质和衰老分子成分的功能互连性，有效的衰老干预措施仍然难以找到

Result: 识别出多个药物重定位候选，这些药物不仅靶向特定衰老标志，还能逆转其衰老相关转录变化

Conclusion: 提供了一个可实验验证的框架，利用基因组发现加速药物重定位以延长寿命，揭示了每种药物调节衰老标志的分子机制

Abstract: Despite the thousands of genes implicated in age-related phenotypes,
effective interventions for aging remain elusive, a lack of advance rooted in
the multifactorial nature of longevity and the functional interconnectedness of
the molecular components implicated in aging. Here, we introduce a network
medicine framework that integrates 2,358 longevity-associated genes onto the
human interactome to identify existing drugs that can modulate aging processes.
We find that genes associated with each hallmark of aging form a connected
subgraph, or hallmark module, a discovery enabling us to measure the proximity
of 6,442 clinically approved or experimental compounds to each hallmark. We
then introduce a transcription-based metric, $pAGE$, which evaluates whether
the drug-induced expression shifts reinforce or counteract known age-related
expression changes. By integrating network proximity and $pAGE$, we identify
multiple drug repurposing candidate that not only target specific hallmarks but
act to reverse their aging-associated transcriptional changes. Our findings are
interpretable, revealing for each drug the molecular mechanisms through which
it modulates the hallmark, offering an experimentally falsifiable framework to
leverage genomic discoveries to accelerate drug repurposing for longevity.

*Majid Aalizadeh,Chinmay Raut,Ali Tabartehfarahani,Xudong Fan*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 通过全谱分析和线性回归提升颜色测定的准确度，均方误差从22,000降至3.87，提升超700倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统颜色测定方法仅使用单一波长信号强度，忽视了全谱传输谱中的结构化信息

Method: 采用前向特征选择策略处理标准化传输谱，结合线性回归和十折交叉验证

Result: 使用食品染料模型系统，均方误差从22,000降至3.87，准确度提升超700倍

Conclusion: 全谱建模方法可在不改变硬件的情况下实现精确浓度预测，应用于医疗诊断、环境监测和工业分析

Abstract: Conventional colorimetric sensing methods typically rely on signal intensity
at a single wavelength, often selected heuristically based on peak visual
modulation. This approach overlooks the structured information embedded in
full-spectrum transmission profiles, particularly in intensity-based systems
where linear models may be highly effective. In this study, we experimentally
demonstrate that applying a forward feature selection strategy to normalized
transmission spectra, combined with linear regression and ten-fold
cross-validation, yields significant improvements in predictive accuracy. Using
food dye dilutions as a model system, the mean squared error was reduced from
over 22,000 with a single wavelength to 3.87 using twelve selected features,
corresponding to a more than 5,700-fold enhancement. These results validate
that full-spectrum modeling enables precise concentration prediction without
requiring changes to the sensing hardware. The approach is broadly applicable
to colorimetric assays used in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring,
and industrial analysis, offering a scalable pathway to improve sensitivity and
reliability in existing platforms.

TL;DR: 提出了epiGPTope语言模型，通过预训练和微调生成新型表位序列，结合分类器预测细菌/病毒来源，加速表位发现和筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表位设计面临组合序列空间巨大的挑战，传统筛选方法不可行，需要新的生成方法来创建可行的表位候选库。

Method: 使用预训练蛋白质数据的语言模型epiGPTope，在线性表位数据上微调，直接生成表位样序列，并训练统计分类器预测序列来源。

Result: 生成的序列具有与已知表位相似的统计特性，能够创建表位候选库，并通过分类器缩小搜索范围。

Conclusion: 生成式与预测式模型结合的方法可辅助表位发现，仅需氨基酸序列，无需几何框架或手工特征，有望加速新生物技术开发。

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

TL;DR: LINKER是首个基于序列的模型，仅使用蛋白质序列和配体SMILES就能预测残基-功能基团相互作用类型，无需3D结构输入


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖3D结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物学相关性，需要开发仅基于序列的相互作用预测方法

Method: 采用结构监督的注意力机制，通过功能基团基序提取从3D蛋白-配体复合物获得交互标签，将配体结构抽象为功能基团

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督能够产生与真实生化注释高度一致的相互作用预测

Conclusion: LINKER通过序列级输入实现大规模应用，在缺乏结构数据的场景下仍能准确预测具有生物学意义的相互作用类型

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.

Abstract: Evaluating the timing and trajectory of sensory system innovations is crucial
for understanding the increase in phylogenetic, behavioural, and ecological
diversity during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Elucidation of sensory
adaptations has relied on either body-fossil evidence based on anatomical
features or qualitative descriptions of trace-fossil morphology, leaving a gap
in the record of sensory system innovations between the development of basic
sensory capacities and that of more advanced sensory organs and brains. Here,
we examine fossil movement trajectories of Ediacaran and Cambrian grazers for
the presence of autocorrelation. Our analysis reveals a lack of temporal
correlation in the studied Ediacaran trajectories and its presence in both
analysed Cambrian trajectories, indicating time-tuned behaviours were in place
by the early Cambrian. These results support the Cambrian Information
Revolution hypothesis and indicates that increases in cognitive complexity and
behavioural strategies were yet another important evolutionary innovation that
occurred during the Ediacaran Cambrian transition.
