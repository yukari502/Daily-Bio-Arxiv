Submitted to a Briefings in\n  Bioinformatics journal and waiting for the outcome", "summary": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic\nchallenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.\nThis study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data\nfrom the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity\n(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by\nthe Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns\nin Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK\nfrom 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,\nepidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance\ndeterminants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We\ninvestigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene\nfor tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with\nbootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%\naccuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,\nSIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially\nexceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden\nprojected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced\nRandom Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by\nincorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend\nmodeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing\nfluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance."}

However, many TDA algorithms are memory intensive and impractical for\nmassive datasets. Here, we introduce a statistical protocol that reduces TDA's\nmemory requirements and gives access to scientists with modest computing\nresources. We validate this protocol against two empirical datasets, showing\nthat it replicates previous findings with much lower memory requirements.\nFinally, we demonstrate the power of the protocol by mapping the topology of\nfunctional correlations for the human cortex at high spatial resolution,\nsomething that was previously infeasible without this novel approach."}

Despite the\nremarkable success of this approach, it remains unclear how to use such finely\ntuned models to study complex biological systems composed of numerous\nheterogeneous, interacting components. One possible strategy for taming this\nbiological complexity is to embrace the idea that many biological behaviors we\nobserve are ``typical'' and can be modeled using random systems that respect\nbiologically-motivated constraints. Here, we review recent works showing how\nthis approach can be used to make close connection with experiments in\nbiological systems ranging from neuroscience to ecology and evolution and\nbeyond. Collectively, these works suggest that the ``random-with-constraints''\nparadigm represents a promising new modeling strategy for capturing\nexperimentally observed dynamical and statistical features in high-dimensional\nbiological data and provides a powerful minimal modeling philosophy for\nbiology."}
