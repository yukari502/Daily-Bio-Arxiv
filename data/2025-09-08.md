TL;DR: cfDNA尺寸流派分析可预测癫疫检查点抗剂治疗效果，长段cfDNA比例与更好的治疗响应相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别能够监测和预测癫疫检查点抗剂治疗响应的非侵入性多皿疗法方法

Method: 在SChISM研究中，使用BIABooster设备分析126名接受ICI治疗的进展性癌症患者的泵液cfDNA尺寸流派，分析基线段片流派变量与早期进展和无进展生存期的关联

Result: 高cfDNA浓度和短段片(111-240bp)与差响应相关，长段片(>300bp)与良好响应相关，>1650bp段片比例最具区分能力(AUC=0.73)，在调整干扰因素后仍显著

Conclusion: cfDNA尺寸流派显著预测ICI响应和复发，效果超过PD-L1化验标记物，反映充分的免疫系统激活

Abstract: Background: Many advanced cancer patients experience progression under
immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) size
profiles offer a promising noninvasive multi-cancer approach to monitor and
predict immunotherapy response. Methods: In the SChISM (Size CfDNA
Immunotherapy Signature Monitoring) study (NCT05083494), pre-treatment
plasmatic cfDNA size profiles from 126 ICI-treated advanced carcinomas were
quantified using the BIABooster device. Fragmentomederived variables
(concentration, peaks' position, and fragment size ranges) at baseline were
analyzed for associations with early progression (EP, progression at first
imaging) and progression-free survival (PFS), using logistic and Cox regression
models. Bootstrap analysis validated robustness. Additional analyses were
performed in homogeneous subpopulations: first-line lung cancer patients (n =
60) and head-andneck patients treated with Nivolumab (n = 25). Results: Higher
cfDNA concentration and high quantities of short fragments (111-240 base pairs
(bp)) were associated with poor response, unlike long fragments (> 300 bp). The
proportion of fragments longer than 1650 bp demonstrated highest discriminatory
power (AUC = 0.73, C-index = 0.69). It was significantly associated with non-EP
(odds ratio = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.25-0.62]) and longer PFS (hazard ratio: 0.54 [95%
CI: 0.42-0.68]). These associations remained significant when adjusted for
confounders (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status,
tumor type, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and across both subpopulations.
Bootstrap analysis confirmed robustness with mean accuracy of 70.1 $\pm$ 4.17%
and positive predictive value of 55.6 $\pm$ 7.37%, in test sets. Conclusion:
cfDNA size profiles significantly predicted ICI response and anticipate
relapse, outperforming the routinely used marker programmed death-ligand 1
immunohistochemistry and reflecting enhanced immune system activation. Trial
registration: (NCT05083494), date of registration: 2021-10-19.

### [2] [Resolving Tangling in Multi-Conformer Refinement via Iterative Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05189)
*Avinash Mandaiya,Veit Elser*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出基于迭代投影的自动化精炼方法，解决蛋白质多构象精炼中的缠绕问题，实现高R因子初始模型的稳健优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有晶体学精炼协议在处理构象异质性时经常因缠绕现象失败，需要能够处理构象异质性的新算法

Method: 基于分治框架的迭代投影方法，允许每个原子独立满足密度约束，整合几何约束和实验密度约束

Result: 有效避免缠绕伪影，即使R因子高达12%的初始模型也能实现稳健的精炼性能

Conclusion: 该方法为推进晶体学方法解决构象异质性和捕获原子分辨率蛋白质动力学奠定了计算基础

Abstract: The advent of advanced crystallographic techniques has shifted structural
biology from static, single-conformer models toward probing protein dynamics.
Extracting cooperative motions from temporally and spatially averaged electron
density maps requires both high-resolution data and refinement algorithms
capable of handling conformational heterogeneity. However, current refinement
protocols often fail due to the tangling phenomenon, in which conformational
states become improperly intertwined during optimization. Here, we present an
automated refinement methodology based on iterative projections within the
divide-and-concur framework. This approach enables seamless integration of
geometric constraints with experimental density constraints derived from
observed scattering amplitudes. By allowing each atom to satisfy density
constraints independently, we show that this framework effectively circumvents
tangling artifacts and achieves robust refinement performance, even for models
initialized with R-factors as high as 12%. Just as iterative projections
revolutionized phase retrieval in crystallography, we demonstrate that they can
also address the optimization challenges in multi-conformational refinement.
This work establishes a computational foundation for advancing crystallographic
methodologies to resolve conformational heterogeneity and ultimately capture
protein dynamics at atomic resolution.

### [3] [When correcting for regression to the mean is worse than no correction at all](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04718)
*José F. Fontanari,Mauro Santos*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 常见RTM校正方法存在缺陷，Berry方法不可靠导致假阳性和假阴性，Blomqvist方法在小样本下效率低。最稳健的方法是使用原始斜率并结合实验可重复性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归均值(RTM)效应在生物学变化研究中干扰统计推断，需要评估现有校正方法的有效性。

Method: 分析比较Berry等方法和Blomqvist方法的性能表现，评估它们在假设检验中的可靠性和效率。

Result: Berry方法在假设检验中不可靠，会产生假阳性和假阴性；Blomqvist方法虽然理论无偏但在小样本下效率低下。

Conclusion: 处理RTM的最稳健方法不是校正数据，而是使用原始斜率并结合实验可重复性评估，缺乏可重复性理解的差异处理效应结论在统计上缺乏依据。

Abstract: The ubiquitous regression to the mean (RTM) effect complicates statistical
inference in biological studies of change. We demonstrate that common RTM
correction methods are flawed: the Berry et al. method popularized by Kelly &
Price in The American Naturalist is unreliable for hypothesis testing, leading
to both false positives and negatives, while the theoretically unbiased
Blomqvist method has poor efficiency in limited sample sizes. Our findings show
that the most robust approach to handling RTM is not to correct the data but to
use the crude slope in conjunction with an assessment of the experiment's
repeatability. Ultimately, we argue that any conclusion about a differential
treatment effect is statistically unfounded without a clear understanding of
the experiment's repeatability.

TL;DR: TumorPred是一个基于R/Shiny的Web应用程序，用于脑肿瘤药物药代动力学的四室模型模拟、敏感性分析和参数计算


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接测量药物在人脑和脑肿瘤中的分布、滞留时间以及药物/患者特异性参数非常困难，需要数学建模方法来预测药物动力学特性

Method: 开发基于R/Shiny的Web应用，使用渗透性限制的四室脑模型进行药物分布模拟，模型模拟人脑功能并预测药物在脑血液、脑组织、颅脑和脊髓脑脊液中的药代动力学

Result: 应用提供实时输出更新，用户可可视化并下载模拟图表和数据表，计算准确性通过Simcyp Simulator验证

Conclusion: TumorPred是一个免费的计算工具和数据驱动资源，可促进药物开发并优化脑癌治疗策略

Abstract: It is difficult or infeasible to directly measure how much of a drug actually
enters the human brain and a brain tumor, how long it remains there, and to
estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters, as well as how changes
in these parameters influence model outputs and pharmacokinetic
characteristics. Compartmental modeling offers a powerful mathematical approach
to describe drug distribution and elimination in the body using systems of
differential equations. This study introduces TumorPred, an R/Shiny-based web
application designed for model simulation, sensitivity analysis, and
pharmacokinetic parameter calculation in a permeability-limited
four-compartment brain model. The model closely mimics human brain
functionality for drug delivery and aims to predict the pharmacokinetics of
drugs in the brain blood, brain mass, and cranial and spinal cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) of the human brain. The app provides real-time output updates in
response to input modifications and allows users to visualize and download
simulated plots and data tables. The computational accuracy of TumorPred is
validated against results from the Simcyp Simulator (Certara Inc.). TumorPred
is freely accessible and serves as an invaluable computational tool and
data-driven resource for advancing drug development and optimizing treatment
strategies for more effective brain cancer therapy.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无需姿态信息的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了高通量流式细胞术中任意几何形状细胞的多轴旋转成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转且需要已知每帧姿态，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，在弱散射假设下联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。

Result: 能够从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖中实现准确重建，仅需10个视图或120度角度范围即可获得高保真结果，首次实现了整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像。

Conclusion: OmniFHT为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案，突破了现有方法的限制。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.
