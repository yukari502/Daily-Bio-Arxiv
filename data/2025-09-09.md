### [1] [Investigating DNA words and their distributions across the tree of life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05539)
*Charalampos Koilakos,Kimonas Provatas,Michail Patsakis,Aris Karatzikos,Ilias Georgakopoulos-Soares*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了超过22.5万个基因组中的k-mer频率分布，发现Zipf定律在建模k-mer分布时表现不佳，提出了截断幂律和Zipf-Mandelbrot分布作为更好的替代模型，并建立了评估人工基因组生物合理性的新标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA k-mer频率分布受基本生物过程影响，能反映基因组结构和进化。先前研究尝试用Zipf定律建模k-mer使用，但该定律在不同物种中的准确性尚不清楚。

Method: 分析了跨越生命三域和病毒的225,000多个基因组组装的k-mer频率谱，比较了Zipf定律、截断幂律和Zipf-Mandelbrot分布的拟合效果，并使用Heaps定律分析词汇扩展和耗尽。

Result: Zipf定律在建模k-mer分布时表现一致不佳，而截断幂律和Zipf-Mandelbrot分布提供了显著改进的拟合效果。基因组大小和GC含量影响模型性能，较大且GC含量不平衡的基因组拟合更好。人工基因组与真实基因组存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了建模基因组k-mer分布的新标准，为合成生物学和进化序列分析提供了重要见解，并提供了评估人工基因组生物合理性的新方法。

Abstract: The frequency distributions of DNA k-mers are shaped by fundamental
biological processes and offer a window into genome structure and evolution.
Inspired by analogies to natural language, prior studies have attempted to
model genomic k-mer usage using Zipf's law, a rank-frequency law originally
formulated for words in human language. However, the extent to which this law
accurately captures the distribution of k-mers across diverse species remains
unclear. Here, we systematically analyze k-mer frequency spectra across more
than 225,000 genome assemblies spanning all three domains of life and viruses.
We demonstrate that Zipf's law consistently underperforms in modeling k-mer
distributions. In contrast, we propose the truncated power law and
Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions, which provide substantially improved fits across
taxonomic groups. We show that genome size and GC content influence model
performance, with larger and GC-content imbalanced genomes yielding better
adherence. Additionally, we perform an extensive analysis on vocabulary
expansion and exhaustion across the same organisms using Heaps' law. We apply
our modeling framework to evaluate simulated genomes generated by k-let
preserving shuffling and deep generative language models. Our results reveal
substantial differences between organismal genomes and their synthetic or
shuffled counterparts, offering a novel approach to benchmark the biological
plausibility of artificial genomes. Collectively, this work establishes new
standards for modeling genomic k-mer distributions and provides insights
relevant to synthetic biology, and evolutionary sequence analysis.

### [2] [Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning: An Algorithmic Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06234)
*Michail Patsakis,Ioannis Mouratidis,Ilias Georgakopoulos-Soares*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种最小成本合成基因组规划算法框架，通过动态规划咈贪算法比较，为大规模基因组构建提供成本效率优化方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成基因组学向更大规模基因组构建发展，需要计算策略来解决技术可行性问题。

Method: 提出了一种算法框架，通过比较动态规划咈贪算法策略，在不同成本制度下寻找最优的基因组合成方案。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2等病毒基因组案例研究中发现，ORF1ab等保守区域可以从相关模板低成本重构，而S基因等高变异区域更依赖DNA合成。

Conclusion: 该算法框架不仅能够优化大规模基因组构建的成本效率，还有助于理解基因组架构咈进化过程，为基因组设计提供生物学咈经济学的权衡交换。

Abstract: As synthetic genomics scales toward the construction of increasingly larger
genomes, computational strategies are needed to address technical feasibility.
We introduce an algorithmic framework for the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome
Planning problem, aiming to identify the most cost-effective strategy to
assemble a target genome from a source genome through a combination of reuse,
synthesis, and join operations. By comparing dynamic programming and greedy
heuristic strategies under diverse cost regimes, we demonstrate how algorithmic
choices influence the cost-efficiency of large-scale genome construction. In
parallel, solving the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning problem can help
us better understand genome architecture and evolution. We applied our
framework in case studies on viral genomes, including SARS-CoV-2, to examine
how source-target genome similarity shapes construction costs. Our analyses
revealed that conserved regions such as ORF1ab can be reconstructed
cost-effectively from related templates, while highly variable regions such as
the S (spike) gene are more reliant on DNA synthesis, highlighting the
biological and economic trade-offs of genome design.

### [3] [ProtSAE: Disentangling and Interpreting Protein Language Models via Semantically-Guided Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05309)
*Xiangyu Liu,Haodi Lei,Yi Liu,Yang Liu,Wei Hu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 通过结合标注数据集和领域知识的语义导向SAE方法，ProtSAE能够在保按重构保真度的同时，学习到更生物学相关和可解释的隐藏特征，解决传统SAE的语义缠结问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏自动编码器(SAE)在生物语言模型解释中存在语义缠结问题，单个神经元混合多个非线性概念，影响了模型行为的可靠解释和操控。

Method: 提出ProtSAE方法，在训练过程中结合标注数据集和领域知识进行语义解缠，减轻缠结属性的影响，而不像现有SAE需要依赖标注数据集来过滤和解释激活。

Result: 解释性实验显示ProtSAE能够学习到更生物学相关和可解释的隐藏特征，性能分析显示其在保按高重构保真度的同时，在可解释探针任务中获得更好结果，并显示在导向下游生成任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: ProtSAE通过语义导向的方法有效解决了传统SAE的语义缠结问题，为生物语言模型的机制解释提供了更有效的工具，并具有在下游生成任务中导向模型行为的潜力。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic
interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein
language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful
features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic
entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts,
making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In
this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike
existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret
activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both
annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled
attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns
more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to
previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE
maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in
interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs
for downstream generation tasks.

### [4] [Comparative study of Bayesian and Frequentist methods for epidemic forecasting: Insights from simulated and historical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05846)
*Hamed Karami,Ruiyan Luo,Pejman Sanaei,Gerardo Chowell*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 比较贝叶斯和频率主义方法在流行病预测中的表现，发现两者各有优势：频率主义方法在疫情高峰期表现更好，而贝叶斯方法在早期阶段和不确定性量化方面更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的流行病预测对公共卫生干预至关重要，需要比较不同统计框架在相同模型结构和误差假设下的预测性能

Method: 使用确定性的区室流行病模型，比较非线性最小二乘优化（频率主义）和基于Stan的MCMC采样贝叶斯推断，在模拟数据集和历史疫情数据上进行评估

Result: 预测性能取决于疫情阶段和数据集特征，没有方法在所有情况下都最优。频率主义方法在峰值和峰值后阶段表现更好，贝叶斯方法在早期阶段和不确定性量化方面更优

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据疫情阶段和数据质量选择适当的估计策略提供了实用指导，有助于更有效的公共卫生干预

Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting is critical for effective public health
interventions. This study compares Bayesian and Frequentist estimation
frameworks within deterministic compartmental epidemic models, focusing on
nonlinear least squares optimization versus Bayesian inference using MCMC
sampling via Stan. We compare forecasting performance under shared modeling
structure and error assumptions for specific implementations of both
approaches.
  We assess performance on simulated datasets (with R0 values of 2 and 1.5) and
historical datasets including the 1918 influenza pandemic, 1896-97 Bombay
plague, and COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error,
Root Mean Squared Error, Weighted Interval Score, and 95% prediction interval
coverage.
  Forecasting performance depends on epidemic phase and dataset
characteristics, with no method consistently outperforming across all contexts.
Frequentist methods perform well at peak and post-peak phases but are less
accurate pre-peak. Bayesian methods, particularly with uniform priors, offer
better early-epidemic accuracy and stronger uncertainty quantification,
especially valuable when data are sparse or noisy. Frequentist methods often
yield more accurate point forecasts with lower error metrics, though their
interval estimates may be less robust.
  We examine how prior choice influences Bayesian forecasts and how extending
forecasting horizons affects convergence. These findings offer practical
guidance for choosing estimation strategies tailored to epidemic phase and data
quality, supporting more effective public health interventions.

### [5] [Hybrid restricted master problem for Boolean matrix factorisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06192)
*Ellen Visscher,Michael Forbes,Christopher Yau*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: bfact是一个Python包，用于执行精确的低秩布尔矩阵分解(BMF)，采用混合组合优化方法，在模拟和真实数据中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够准确进行布尔矩阵分解的工具，特别是在估计真实秩和信号恢复方面表现出色

Method: 使用基于聚类算法生成先验候选因子的混合组合优化方法，选择最佳不相交因子，然后执行第二次组合或启发式算法来恢复BMF

Result: 在模拟设置中能很好地估计矩阵的真实秩；在真实基准测试中（使用人类肺细胞图谱的单细胞RNA测序数据集），bfact实现了强信号恢复，且秩更低

Conclusion: bfact是一个有效的布尔矩阵分解工具，在秩估计和信号恢复方面表现优异，特别适用于生物信息学数据分析

Abstract: We present bfact, a Python package for performing accurate low-rank Boolean
matrix factorisation (BMF). bfact uses a hybrid combinatorial optimisation
approach based on a priori candidate factors generated from clustering
algorithms. It selects the best disjoint factors before performing either a
second combinatorial or heuristic algorithm to recover the BMF. We show that
bfact does particularly well at estimating the true rank of matrices in
simulated settings. In real benchmarks, using a collation of single-cell
RNA-sequencing datasets from the Human Lung Cell Atlas, we show that bfact
achieves strong signal recovery, with a much lower rank.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机制模型方法在处理趋于复杂化的生物过程时遇到困难，需要补充性的数据驱动方法来推断模型结构。

Method: 调研了三类主要方法：回归基础方法、网络基础架构和分解技术，并在Oregonator非线性振荡器模型上进行对比评估。

Conclusion: 通过展示各种方法的优势、限制咏可解释性，为研究人员选择适合的工具来分析生命科学中的复杂非线性高维动力学提供了指南。

Abstract: Dynamical systems theory describes how interacting quantities change over
time and space, from molecular oscillators to large-scale biological patterns.
Such systems often involve nonlinear feedbacks, delays, and interactions across
scales. Classical modeling derives explicit governing equations, often systems
of differential equations, by combining mechanistic assumptions, experimental
observations, and known physical laws. The growing complexity of biological
processes has, however, motivated complementary data-driven methods that aim to
infer model structure directly from measurements, often without specifying
equations a priori. In this review, we survey approaches for model discovery in
biological dynamical systems, focusing on three methodological families:
regression-based methods, network-based architectures, and decomposition
techniques. We compare their ability to address three core goals: forecasting
future states, identifying interactions, and characterizing system states.
Representative methods are applied to a common benchmark, the Oregonator model,
a minimal nonlinear oscillator that captures shared design principles of
chemical and biological systems. By highlighting strengths, limitations, and
interpretability, we aim to guide researchers in selecting tools for analyzing
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional dynamics in the life sciences.

### [7] [Fast-Slow Analysis of a Model For the Stimulation of Enzymatic Activity by a Competitive Inhibitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06268)

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 竞争性抑制剂在低到中等剂量下可以反常地刺激酶促反应。研究发现PGK1酶的竞争性抑制模型预测了这种刺激现象，并提出三时间尺度简化模型保留了关键特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索竞争性抑制剂反常刺激酶促反应的机制，为开发新型酶激活疗法提供理论基础，因为酶激活剂比抑制剂更罕见且难以设计。

Method: 采用详细的质量作用模型研究PGK1酶的竞争性抑制，然后提出三时间尺度简化模型，推导出保留关键特征的速率方程。

Result: 简化模型得到的速率方程保持了竞争性抑制剂刺激的三个基本属性：双相剂量响应、对产物解离速率的依赖性以及刺激可能的参数区域。

Conclusion: 竞争性抑制剂刺激是双产物酶的内在特征，简化模型为理解这一现象提供了数学框架，有助于新型治疗方法的开发。

Abstract: Competitive inhibitors can, paradoxically, stimulate an enzymatic reaction at
low to moderate doses. Competitive inhibition of an enzyme occurs when an
inhibitor binds to the enzyme's binding site and blocks the enzyme's target
molecule from binding. We recently proposed a detailed but straightforward mass
action model for competitive inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) by
Terazosin (TZ). The full PGK1 model has two substrates and two products which
can be bound and released in either order, known as a random bi-bi mechanism.
This model, with no further modification, predicts an increased reaction rate
at low or moderate TZ doses, suggesting that stimulation is an intrinsic
feature of competitive inhibition in enzymes with two products. This mechanism
can aid in the development of novel therapies, particularly since enzyme
activators are more rare and difficult to design than inhibitors. Here we
propose a three-timescale reduction of that detailed model and show that the
resulting rate equation retains three essential attributes of competitive
inhibitor stimulation. These attributes are the biphasic dose response, the
dependence on the relative rates of product dissociation from the binary and
ternary complexes, and the parameter region where stimulation is possible. The
resulting rate equation is a rational function which is a Monod function of
each substrate, but quadratic in the denominator as a function of inhibitor
dose.

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 量子启发的张量网络框架，使用量子互信息量化基因依赖关系，构建稳健的基因互作网络，能有效区分真实调控模式与噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉高阶非线性基因互作关系，需要新方法来解析复杂的基因调控网络。

Method: 利用张量网络将表达数据映射到低维表示，使用量子互信息量化基因依赖性，通过置换检验建立统计显著性。

Result: 成功从28,000多个淋巴母细胞的单细胞RNA测序数据中重建了包含6个通路基因的调控网络，并揭示了多个三重调控机制。

Conclusion: 将量子物理启发技术与计算生物学结合，为基因调控研究提供了新见解，在疾病机制和精准医疗中有应用价值。

Abstract: Deciphering complex gene-gene interactions remains challenging in
transcriptomics as traditional methods often miss higher-order and nonlinear
dependencies. This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging
tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional
representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information
(QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene
dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing.
This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect
biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The
approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental
noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a
gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA
sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we
unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics
inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel
insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and
precision medicine.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 研究了三种纳米机器人群算法（KM、KMA、KMAR）在散布式癌症治疗中的敏性药物投送性能，KMAR算法在各种癌症分布模式下都表现最优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决散布式多个癌症病灶的精准药物投送问题，需要根据各病灶的需求合理分配药物货载，提高治疗效果和减少副作用

Method: 建立纳米机器人行为和胶体环境的数学模型，基于实验数据构建化学港度上下移动模型，提出三种算法：KM（基于自然化学信号）、KMA（增强化学信号）、KMAR（增加负化学向性控制）

Result: KM算法在化学信号弱时治疗速度过慢；KMA算法提高了治疗速度但终构成就低，仅在集中式癌症模式下表现良好；KMAR算法在所有癌症模式下都表现出艰固的适应性和优秀性能

Conclusion: KMAR算法通过结合正负化学向性控制，能够在各种散布式癌症情况下实现高效、精准的药物投送，为纳米机器人群治疗提供了有效的协调策略

Abstract: Motile nanosized particles, or "nanobots", promise more effective and less
toxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We
consider the case in which the cancer is "diffuse", dispersed such that there
are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of
nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at
the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be
allocated between sites according to their "demands"; this requires extra
nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the
nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement
model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in
which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three
algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of
reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that
surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional
chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third
algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts
the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that
they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present
simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer
arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless
the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses
too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment
speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns.
For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer
patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Abstract: The majority of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the market are
produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured at scale in
chemically defined cell culture medium. Because of the high costs associated
with mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high
product titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of
nutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to
sustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the
desired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often
solubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the
solution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media
configurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and
laborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools
to understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the
pairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity
coefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of
two amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC
group interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the
multi-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data
collected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system
amino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation
predictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and
quaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model
as a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by
replacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational
predictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex
mixtures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种对E值进行标准化调整的方法，通过考虑查询序列和主题序列的自匹配来修正相似性比较中的异常，从而得到更适合数据库应用的规范相似性和相异性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列比对工具（如BLAST和FASTA）使用比对分数和E值作为搜索结果质量的指标，但在不同查询结果的交叉比较中，这些指标的解读存在细微差别，需要区分不同类型的相似性。

Method: 通过调整E值来考虑查询序列和主题序列的自匹配，修正相似性比较中的表面异常，从而得到规范的相异性和相似性度量。

Result: 规范化的E值相异性改善了聚类效果和子集选择的多样性。规范E值不仅具有正定性和对称性，还满足自反性和三角不等式，可以作为蛋白质序列度量空间的适当距离函数。

Conclusion: 提出的E值标准化方法能够更准确地衡量序列相似性，为数据库应用（如全对全序列比对或多样化子集选择）提供了更合适的度量标准，使E值成为蛋白质序列度量空间的有效距离函数。

Abstract: Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in
searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered
nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment
scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from
querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and
inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and
the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from
sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score
as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat
nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of
similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching
of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous
similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity
measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as
all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual
practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and
the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value
share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric
space, the canonical E value itself is also reflexive and meets the condition
of triangle inequality, thus an appropriate distance function for a metric
space of protein sequences.

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.
