However, the\ninherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical\nspecificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital\npathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in\nsimulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,\nwe extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image\ntranslation to generate artificially stained slices from\nsynchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image\npairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant\nsamples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired\ndata. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of\nthe CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The\nmodel incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,\nproducing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving\nhigh-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard\nCycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the\nmodel can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D\ndatasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.\nWhile features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some\nvariability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need\nfor further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining\nto 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,\nlabel-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5fae\u7a0bCT\u626b\u63cf\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u76843D\u538b\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347X\u5c04\u7ebf\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u7ef4X\u5c04\u7ebf\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u7070\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u7406\u5207\u7247\u6216\u5316\u5b66\u67d3\u8272\u7684\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fee\u6539\u7248CycleGAN\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e50\u4e2a\u5fae\u7a0bCT\u4e0e\u5851\u84dd\u67d3\u8272\u538b\u7247\u7684\u5bf9\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u50cf\u7d20\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u7070\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u9879", "result": "\u5728SSIM\u3001PSNR\u548cLPIPS\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86Pix2Pix\u548c\u6807\u51c6CycleGAN\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u8f93\u51fa\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a3D X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u5584\u67d3\u8272\u6548\u679c"}}
