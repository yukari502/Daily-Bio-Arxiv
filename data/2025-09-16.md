### [1] [Generalized Additive Modeling of TRPM4-Ribo Transcriptional Space in Prostate Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12073)
*Kah Keng Wong*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 该研究开发了CEP-IP框架，基于TRPM4与核糖体基因的GAM模型，将前列腺癌细胞分为四个象限亚群，揭示了不同的生物学功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRPM4在前列腺癌中过表达且与转移复发相关，但缺乏单细胞水平的功能研究，需要开发新方法来识别癌细胞亚群及其生物学特征。

Method: 使用Spearman-Kendall双过滤筛选基因，建立TRPM4与核糖体基因集的GAM模型，设计细胞解释力分类(CEP)和拐点(IP)分析来识别细胞亚群。

Result: TRPM4-核糖体基因模型优于其他癌基因集，CEP-IP框架成功将癌细胞分为四个象限，前IP TREP细胞富集免疫相关功能，后IP TREP细胞富集核糖体和细胞粘附功能。

Conclusion: CEP-IP框架能够有效识别癌细胞亚群并揭示其独特的生物学特征，具有潜在的治疗应用价值。

Abstract: TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or
recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4
characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. In this study,
generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to model the relationship between
TRPM4 and genes shortlisted using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter in aggressive
PCa and benign prostate (BP) control cells derived from scRNA-seq dataset.
Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, and RPS26;
averaged into Ribo as the gene set), passed the dual-filter specifically in PCa
cells. GAM modeling of TRPM4-Ribo significantly outperformed TRPM4 modeling
with alternative cancer gene sets (GSK-3B, mTOR, NF-KB, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt).
Cell explanatory power (CEP) classification was devised and verified by
cross-validation to identify individual PCa cells most well-predicted by the
model. CEP classification binarized PCa cells into top-ranked explanatory power
(TREP; more well-predicted by the model) and non-TREP cells. In TRPM4-Ribo GAM
plots, distribution pattern of TREP cells shifted at an inflection point (IP)
i.e., the specific TRPM4 expression value that further binarized the plot into
pre-IP (TRPM4 values below IP) and post-IP (TRPM4 values above IP) regions,
producing a quadrant of TREP versus non-TREP cells for each PCa patient. Gene
Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that pre-IP TREP cells enriched for
immune-related GOs, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal,
translation, and cell adhesion GOs. In conclusion, the CEP-IP framework based
on pairwise genes produces quadrants of cancer cell subpopulations, enabling
the identification of distinctive biology with potential therapeutic
implications.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种自动化框架来定量分析斑点和条纹图案的特征和不规则性，并说明了不同的持久同调方法如何为生物系统提供补充性的见解。

Abstract: Complex patterns emerge across a wide range of biological systems. While such
patterns often exhibit remarkable robustness, variation and irregularity exist
at multiple scales and can carry important information about the underlying
agent interactions driving collective dynamics. Many methods for quantifying
biological patterns focus on large-scale, characteristic features (such as
stripe width or spot number), but questions remain on how to characterize messy
patterns. In the case of cellular patterns that emerge during development or
regeneration, understanding where patterns are most susceptible to variability
may help shed light on cell behavior and the tissue environment. Motivated by
these challenges, we introduce methods based on topological data analysis to
classify and quantify messy patterns arising from agent-based interactions, by
extracting meaningful biological interpretations from persistence barcode
summaries. To compute persistent homology, our methods rely on a sweeping-plane
filtration which, in comparison to the Vietoris--Rips filtration, is more
rarely applied to biological systems. We demonstrate how results from the
sweeping-plane filtration can be interpreted to quantify stripe patterns (with
and without interruptions) by analyzing in silico zebrafish skin patterns, and
we generate new quantitative predictions about which pattern features may be
most robust or variable. Our work provides an automated framework for
quantifying features and irregularities in spot and stripe patterns and
highlights how different approaches to persistent homology can provide
complementary insight into biological systems.

### [3] [An Alignment-Free Explanation for Collective Predator Evasion in Moving Animal Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11083)
*Daniel Strömbom,Catherine Futterman*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了动物群体避免捕食者的集体行为，发现仅靠吸引和排斥作用就能实现有效的集体避免，无需速度对齐机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对动物群体避免捕食者的解释要求个体间必须有速度对齐，但实验证明某些动物并不使用对齐机制，因此需要找到新的解释机制。

Method: 通过研究证明仅靠吸引和排斥作用就能引发有效的集体捕食者避免行为，分析了直接观察到捕食者的个体与未观察到的个体之间的速度差异对避免效果的影响。

Result: 研究发现集体捕食者避免并不需要对齐机制，速度差异对避免成功和集体避免速度有影响，但不是必需条件。仅靠吸引和排斥作用就能实现有效避免。

Conclusion: 这项研究将集体捕食者避免加入了仅靠吸引和排斥就能实现的现象范畴，建议进一步的实验研究来深入理解集体行为和集体运动机制。

Abstract: Moving animal groups consist of many distinct individuals but can operate and
function as one unit when performing different tasks. Effectively evading
unexpected predator attacks is one primary task for many moving groups. The
current explanation for predator evasion responses in moving animal groups
require the individuals in the groups interact via (velocity) alignment.
However, experiments have shown that some animals do not use alignment. This
suggests that another explanation for the predator evasion capacity in at least
these species is needed. Here we establish that effective collective predator
evasion does not require alignment, it can be induced via attraction and
repulsion alone. We also show that speed differences between individuals that
have directly observed the predator and those that have not influence evasion
success and the speed of the collective evasion process, but are not required
to induce the phenomenon. Our work here adds collective predator evasion to a
number of phenomena previously thought to require alignment interactions that
have recently been shown to emerge from attraction and repulsion alone. Based
on our findings we suggest experiments and make predictions that may lead to a
deeper understanding of not only collective predator evasion, but also
collective motion in general.

Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed
for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based
program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through
an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the
framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training
data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform
GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting
interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The
end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature
extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular
architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while
supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several
unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework
demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary
tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a
CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and
clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized
medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

### [5] [Neural networks for learning macroscopic chemotactic sensitivity from microscopic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12131)
*Radek Erban*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 使用神经网络从微观模型数据中估计宏观化学敏感性系数，平桥个体行为与群体描述之间的间隔


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对于复杂或非线性微观模型，传统分析法无法浣清微观参数与宏观PDE系数的关系，需要新方法来实现微观到宏观的映射

Method: 研究三种微观化学模型，使用神经网络从微观模拟数据中直接估计宏观PDE的化学敏感性系数

Result: 神经网络成功估计了宏观化学敏感性系数，并与在特定参数范围内可以洞清的分析PDE进行了比较

Conclusion: 神经网络提供了一种有效的方法来实现微观模型到宏观PDE的映射，特别是在传统分析法无法应用的复杂情况下

Abstract: The macroscopic (population-level) dynamics of chemotactic cell movement --
arising from underlying microscopic (individual-based) models -- are often
described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the
spatio-temporal evolution of cell concentrations. In certain cases, these
macroscopic PDEs can be analytically derived from microscopic models, thereby
elucidating the dependence of PDE coefficients on the parameters of the
underlying individual-based dynamics. However, such analytical derivations are
not always feasible, particularly for more complex or nonlinear microscopic
models. In these instances, neural networks offer a promising alternative for
estimating the coefficients of macroscopic PDEs directly from data generated by
microscopic simulations. In this work, three microscopic models of chemotaxis
are investigated. The macroscopic chemotaxis sensitivity is estimated using
neural networks, thereby bridging the gap between individual-level behaviours
and population-level descriptions. The results are compared with macroscopic
PDEs, which can be derived for each model in certain parameter regimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivation: Accurate classification of mitotic figures into normal and
atypical types is crucial for tumor prognostication in digital pathology.
However, developing robust deep learning models for this task is challenging
due to the subtle morphological differences, as well as significant class and
hardness imbalances in real-world histopathology datasets. Methods: We propose
a novel deep learning approach based on a ResNet backbone with specialized
classification heads. Our architecture uniquely models both the mitotic figure
phenotype and the instance difficulty simultaneously. This method is
specifically designed to handle the challenges of diverse tissue types, scanner
variability, and imbalanced data. We employed focal loss to effectively
mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation
pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and
generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent
performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it
achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505
+/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary
leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/-
0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable
solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By
addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the
potential to support precise prognostic assessments in clinical practice and
improve consistency in pathological diagnosis.

Abstract: Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for
identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled
the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs;
however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease
similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised
deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link
prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data.
Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of
omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs
were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph
neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction
accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of
0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link
probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new
drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing
the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.
