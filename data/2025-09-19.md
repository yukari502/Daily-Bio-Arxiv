Motivation: 现有模型只能处理简单的二元标签，无法优化复杂的高维属性（如荧光光谱、稳定性、抗菌活性等）。需要开发能够处理复杂属性空间的序列设计方法。

Method: 提出PrIVAE框架，将属性空间建模为高维流形，使用最近邻图近似局部几何结构。采用图神经网络编码层和等距正则化器来指导潜在表示学习。

Result: 在DNA序列模板荧光金属纳米团簇和抗菌肽设计任务中表现出色，保持了高重建精度并按照属性组织潜在空间。湿实验显示稀有属性纳米团簇富集度提高16.1倍。

Conclusion: PrIVAE能够有效学习属性组织的潜在空间，实现具有期望特性的序列理性设计，在纳米材料和生物医学应用中具有重要实用价值。

Abstract: Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional
properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors,
antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to
optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of
DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and
antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely
on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than
high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a
geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which
learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property
space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold
that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an
appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide
the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder
layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized
latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired
properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our
framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template
fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The
trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent
space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ
sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to
16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance
in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.

TL;DR: 这研究比较了动态生境指数(DHI)和传统土地利用模型在物种分布模型中的预测能力，发现DHI能提供更空间中立的预测效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的土地利用/土地覆盖(LULC)指标在物种分布模型中存在空间偏差问题，需要找到更中立的预测方法

Method: 使用Sentinel-2遥感数据和LULC分类数据，建立了十一种鸟类、两栖类和哺乳动物的集成分布模型，使用九种算法并通过CBI和校准AUC评估

Result: 两种方法在预测准确性上相似，但二值化后生境适宜性地图显著分异；LULC模型存在空间约束，而RS模型不受地理偏差影响

Conclusion: DHI提供了一种更空间中立的替代方案，在区域尺度模拟物种岛时具有广阔前景

Abstract: This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index
(DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and
variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species
distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built
using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in
\^Ile-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and
LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to
habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated
with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability
scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap
indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS
and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After
binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While
LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased
as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used
continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects.
These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based
SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a
promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.
