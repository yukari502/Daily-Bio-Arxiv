Motivation: 现有模型只能处理简单二元标签，无法优化高维复杂功能属性（如荧光光谱、稳定性、抗菌活性等），需要开发能够保持属性空间几何结构的序列设计方法。

Method: 提出PrIVAE框架：将属性空间建模为高维流形，通过最近邻图保持几何结构；使用图神经网络编码层和等距正则化器；学习属性组织的潜在空间用于序列设计。

Result: 模型保持高重建精度，潜在空间按属性组织；湿实验显示DNA纳米团簇设计中稀有属性富集达16.1倍，显著优于训练数据中的丰度。

Conclusion: PrIVAE成功解决了高维复杂属性优化问题，为生物序列设计提供了有效的几何保持框架，在实验验证中展现出实用价值。

Abstract: Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional
properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors,
antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to
optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of
DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and
antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely
on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than
high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a
geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which
learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property
space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold
that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an
appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide
the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder
layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized
latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired
properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our
framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template
fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The
trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent
space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ
sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to
16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance
in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.

### [2] [Modelling species distributions using remote sensing predictors: Comparing Dynamic Habitat Index and LULC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14862)

TL;DR: 这研究比较了动态生境指数(DHI)和传统土地利用/覆盖(LULC)指标在物种分布模型中的预测能力，发现DHI在空间偏差方面更优。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估遥感基于生境生产力的指数(DHI)与传统LULC指标在物种分布模型中的表现差异，以找到更好的生物多样性保护工具。

Method: 使用11种鸟类、两栖类和哺乳动物的分布数据，分别构建遥感(Sentinel-2)和LULC基础的集成模型，使用9种算法进行评估。

Result: 两种方法预测准确性相似，但二值化后生境适宜性地图差异显著。LULC模型存在空间约束，而DHI模型因使用连续数据而没有空间偏差。

Conclusion: DHI提供了更中立的空间预测方法，是区域尺度物种岛寄模型的有前景预测因子，需要考虑LULC模型中的空间偏巢。

Abstract: This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index
(DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and
variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species
distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built
using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in
\^Ile-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and
LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to
habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated
with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability
scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap
indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS
and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After
binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While
LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased
as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used
continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects.
These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based
SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a
promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.
