One common challenge is the ability to\noptimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of\nDNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and\nantimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely\non simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than\nhigh-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a\ngeometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which\nlearns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property\nspace. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold\nthat can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an\nappropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide\nthe sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder\nlayers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized\nlatent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired\nproperties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our\nframework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template\nfluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The\ntrained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent\nspace according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ\nsampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to\n16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance\nin training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPrIVAE\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u529f\u80fd\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5728DNA\u7eb3\u7c73\u56e2\u7c07\u548c\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b016.1\u500d\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u5bcc\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u4e8c\u5143\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u529f\u80fd\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6297\u83cc\u6d3b\u6027\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u5c5e\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrIVAE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u5c5e\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u56fe\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u5c42\u548c\u7b49\u8ddd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7528\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6309\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff1b\u6e7f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aDNA\u7eb3\u7c73\u56e2\u7c07\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7a00\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u5bcc\u96c6\u8fbe16.1\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PrIVAE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u5c5e\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated\nwith the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability\nscores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap\nindices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS\nand LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After\nbinarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly.
