Motivation: 现有模型只能处理简单的二元标签，无法优化复杂的高维功能属性（如荧光光谱、抗菌活性等），需要开发能够处理复杂属性空间的序列设计方法。

Method: 将属性空间建模为高维流形，通过最近邻图近似局部几何结构；使用图神经网络编码层和等距正则化器来引导序列潜在表示；利用训练好的解码器进行理性序列设计。

Result: 在DNA序列模板荧光金属纳米团簇和抗菌肽设计任务中，模型保持了高重建精度，同时根据属性组织潜在空间；湿实验显示稀有属性纳米团簇富集度提高16.1倍。

Conclusion: PrIVAE框架能够有效学习属性组织的潜在空间，为具有复杂功能特性的生物序列设计提供了实用工具，在纳米材料和药物发现等领域具有应用价值。

Abstract: Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional
properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors,
antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to
optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of
DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and
antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely
on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than
high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a
geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which
learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property
space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold
that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an
appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide
the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder
layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized
latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired
properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our
framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template
fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The
trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent
space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ
sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to
16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance
in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.

### [2] [Modelling species distributions using remote sensing predictors: Comparing Dynamic Habitat Index and LULC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14862)

TL;DR: 这研究比较了动态生境指数(DHI)和传统土地利用模型在物种分布模型中的预测能力，发现DHI在空间偏差处理方面更优。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的土地利用/土地覆盖(LULC)模型在物种分布模型中存在空间偏差问题，需要找到更中立的预测变量来提高模型的空间准确性。

Method: 使用在巴黎地区的11种鸟类、两梗类和哺乳动物分布数据，分别构建遥感感经(RS)基于DHI和LULC基于欧几里得距离的SDM模型，使用9种算法构建集成模型并进行评估。

Result: 两种方法在预测准确性上相似，但二值化后的生境适宜性地图存在显著差异。LULC模型受到空间约束，而RS模型使用连续数据没有地理偏差。

Conclusion: DHI作为一种空间中立的遥感感经预测变量，在区域尺度的物种生境模型中具有很大潜力，需要在LULC基于模型中考虑空间偏差问题。

Abstract: This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index
(DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and
variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species
distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built
using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in
\^Ile-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and
LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to
habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated
with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability
scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap
indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS
and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After
binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While
LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased
as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used
continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects.
These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based
SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a
promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.
