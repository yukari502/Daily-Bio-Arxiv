These curves are often\nshown without error bands, and even when error bands are provided, they\ntypically only account for the statistical uncertainty resulting from the\nfinite number of patients in the study. In reality, other sources of\nuncertainty affect the measurements as well. As datasets grow, the statistical\nuncertainty on the number of patients no longer dominates the overall\nuncertainty, and other uncertainties are increasingly important to model. The\nKoMbine package, developed based on procedures used in particle physics,\nprovides the first method to propagate both statistical and systematic\nuncertainties through the Kaplan--Meier curve estimation processes."}

Variability stems from biological differences, PCR\namplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency,\nmaking it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous\ndatasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its\ninterpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix\nTheory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal\ncomponents using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel\nbiwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that\nsimultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use\nof an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering\nsparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains\nthe interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of\nsparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and\nfour sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves\nthe reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-,\nautoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks."}

We present a\nframework that recasts modeling choices as testable mechanistic hypotheses and\nsupplies a simple protocol for rejecting inappropriate model specifications,\nsuch as under-/over-parameterization or invalid simplifying assumptions, based\non predefined criteria before any parameter inference. The key idea is expected\nmodel behavior under feature generalization constraints: instead of judging a\nmodel solely by how well it fits a specific target feature of interest Y at an\noptimal parameter set, we evaluate the model's expected Y output when the model\nis constrained to reproduce a broader, or distinct, feature Z over the entire\nparameter space. We then assess whether a mirror statistical model, derived\nfrom the model's expected Y outputs, to the empirical statistical model using\nstandard statistics. In synthetic experiments with known ground truth (Wilson\nCowan dynamics), the framework correctly rejects mis-specified hypotheses,\npenalizes unnecessary degrees of freedom, and preserves valid specifications.\nThis provides a practical, hypothesis-first route to using mechanistic models\nfor neuroimaging without requiring expert-level methodology."}
