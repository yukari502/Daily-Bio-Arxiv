However, this capability also poses substantial dual-use risks,\nincluding the potential for creating pathogens, viruses, and even bioweapons.\nTo address these biosecurity challenges, we introduce two innovative\nwatermarking techniques to reliably track the designed DNA: DNAMark and\nCentralMark. DNAMark employs synonymous codon substitutions to embed watermarks\nin DNA sequences while preserving the original function. CentralMark further\nadvances this by creating inheritable watermarks that transfer from DNA to\ntranslated proteins, leveraging protein embeddings to ensure detection across\nthe central dogma. Both methods utilize semantic embeddings to generate\nwatermark logits, enhancing robustness against natural mutations, synthesis\nerrors, and adversarial attacks. Evaluated on our therapeutic DNA benchmark,\nDNAMark and CentralMark achieve F1 detection scores above 0.85 under various\nconditions, while maintaining over 60% sequence similarity to ground truth and\ndegeneracy scores below 15%. A case study on the CRISPR-Cas9 system underscores\nCentralMark's utility in real-world settings. This work establishes a vital\nframework for securing DNA language models, balancing innovation with\naccountability to mitigate biosecurity risks."}

However, state-of-the-art\nDNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing\ninconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which\nundermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement\nConsistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning\nobjective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction\non a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate\nRCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA,\nDNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification,\nscalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR\nsubstantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips\nand errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to\nbaselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating\na key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a\nsingle, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning\nrecipe for diverse biology tasks."}

They often occur at concentrations lower than those causing\nphysiological damage, yet their consequences for organisms' fitness and\npopulation dynamics remain unclear. Moreover, it is still uncertain how these\nbehavioural endpoints align with traditional toxicological apical endpoints\nused to assess species sensitivities in risk assessment. This study evaluates\nthe correlation between thresholds triggering locomotor reactions with LC50\nvalues across 19 freshwater and 12 marine invertebrate species exposed to the\ninsecticide imidacloprid and the metal copper. Behavioural responses were\nmeasured via videotracking during pulse exposure assays, while 96h acute tests\nprovided species-specific LC50 values for copper. Results reveal strong\ndiscrepancies: some highly sensitive species showed no locomotor changes,\nwhereas others tolerant to lethality displayed strong movement responses. For\ninstance, freshwater annelids and gastropods responded markedly to\nimidacloprid, while marine shrimps exhibited hyperactivity under low copper\nlevels. These findings indicate that relying solely on lethality-based data may\nunderestimate the fraction of species affected by contamination. Integrating\nbehavioural endpoints into population risk assessment frameworks is therefore\ncrucial to better protect aquatic biodiversity."}

Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across\ndifferent but related problems, it is natural to question whether these\narchitectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In\nthis paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein\nfolding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein\nfolding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving\ntriangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training\nobjectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs\nstandard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a\ngenerative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale\nSimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein\nstructures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks,\nSimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble\nprediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic\nreconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold\nshows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware.\nSimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures\ndesigns in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future\nprogress."}

Cross-session correlations for four\ndifferent choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus\nphases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise\ninterval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems.\nWhile validated in healthy participants, our results represent a first step\ntowards providing clinicians with an interpretable tool for detecting\nneurophysiological abnormalities and provides quantifiable metrics for system\noptimization."}
