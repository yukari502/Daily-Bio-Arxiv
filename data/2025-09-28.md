TL;DR: cAItomorph是一个基于transformer的可解释AI模型，通过外周血细胞形态学图像分类血液恶性肿瘤，准确率达68%，在急性白血病检测中F1分数达74%，可减少不必要的骨髓穿刺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外周血涂片是诊断血液肿瘤的重要工具，但由于肿瘤转化通常发生在骨髓，可能无法在外周血中检测到异常，这带来了诊断挑战。

Method: 使用基于DinoBloom血液学基础模型的transformer架构，对6115名患者和495名健康对照的外周血单细胞图像进行编码和聚合，分为22个详细类别和7个粗类别。

Result: 在7种疾病分类中总体准确率为68±1%，急性白血病F1分数74±2%，骨髓增殖性肿瘤75±3%，无恶性肿瘤82±3%。前2预测准确率提升至84±1%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI辅助诊断在血液恶性肿瘤中的潜力，基于真实世界数据训练的模型可提高诊断准确性并减少侵入性操作。

Abstract: Peripheral blood smears remain a cornerstone in the diagnosis of
hematological neoplasms, offering rapid and valuable insights that inform
subsequent diagnostic steps. However, since neoplastic transformations
typically arise in the bone marrow, they may not manifest as detectable
aberrations in peripheral blood, presenting a diagnostic challenge. In this
paper, we introduce cAItomorph, an explainable transformer-based AI model,
trained to classify hematological malignancies based on peripheral blood
cytomorphology. Our data comprises peripheral blood single-cell images from
6115 patients with diagnoses confirmed by cytomorphology, cytogenetics,
molecular genetics, and immunophenotyping from bone marrow samples, and 495
healthy controls, categorized into 22 detailed and 7 coarse classes. cAItomorph
leverages the DinoBloom hematology foundation model and aggregates image
encodings via a transformer-based architecture into a single vector. It
achieves an overall accuracy of 68$\pm$1% (mean$\pm$s.d., 5-fold
cross-validation) in 7-disease classification, with F1 scores of 74$\pm$2% for
acute leukemia, 75$\pm$3% for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 82$\pm$3% for no
malignancy cases. The overall accuracy increases to 84$\pm$1% in top-2
predictions. By analyzing multi-head attentions, we demonstrate clinically
relevant cell-level attentions and pixel-level heatmaps. Moreover, our model's
calibrated prediction probabilities reduced the false discovery rate from 13.8%
to 12% without missing any acute leukemia cases, thereby decreasing the number
of unnecessary bone marrow aspirations. Our code, test data, and model weights
are publicly available to ensure reproducibility. This study highlights the
potential of AI-assisted diagnostics in hematological malignancies,
illustrating how models trained on real-world data could enhance diagnostic
accuracy and reduce invasive procedures.

### [2] [Detecting disease progression from animal movement using hidden Markov models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21132)
*Dongmin Kim,Théo Michelot,Katherine Mertes,Jared A. Stabach,John Fieberg*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出一种基于隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)的框架，通过动物运动数据推断感染状态，结合流行病学模型结构来检测野生动物疾病。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物感染数据难以获取，但病原体感染会改变宿主运动行为，因此可通过动物轨迹推断感染状态，这对野生动物疾病监测和种群管理至关重要。

Method: 使用隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)框架，将观察到的运动行为与未观察到的感染状态联系起来，结合流行病学模型结构，包括约束转移概率、协变量效应和多尺度转换的分层HMM。

Result: 与兽医诊断报告对比显示，具有流行病学约束的HMM成功识别了感染相关的运动减少，而无约束模型未能捕捉疾病进展。模拟显示约束HMM能准确分类易感、感染和恢复状态。

Conclusion: 该框架为从运动数据检测感染提供了可转移的方法，可增强野生动物疾病监测，指导种群管理，并改善对疾病动态的理解。

Abstract: Understanding disease dynamics is crucial for managing wildlife populations
and assessing spillover risk to domestic animals and humans, but infection data
on free-ranging animals are difficult to obtain. Because pathogen and parasite
infections can alter host movement, infection status may be inferred from
animal trajectories. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework that
links observed movement behaviors to unobserved infection states, consistent
with epidemiological compartmental models (e.g., susceptible, infected,
recovered, dead). Using movement data from 84 reintroduced scimitar-horned oryx
(Oryx dammah), 38 confirmed dead in the field and 6 sampled for disease
testing, we demonstrate how HMMs can incorporate epidemiological structure
through (1) constrained transition probabilities (e.g., to preclude or allow
recovery), (2) covariate effects on transmission, and (3) hierarchically
structured HMMs (HHMMs) for multi-scale transitions. Comparing veterinary
diagnostic reports with model outputs, we found that HMMs with epidemiological
constraints successfully identified infection-associated reductions in
movement, whereas unconstrained models failed to capture disease progression.
Simulations further showed that constrained HMMs accurately classified
susceptible, infected, and recovered states. By illustrating flexible
formulations and a workflow for model selection, we provide a transferable
approach for detecting infection from movement data. This framework can enhance
wildlife disease surveillance, guide population management, and improve
understanding of disease dynamics.

### [3] [SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239)
*Shakib Khan,Fariba Dambandkhameneh,Nazim Shaikh,Yao Nie,Raghavan Venugopal,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SlideMamba框架，结合Mamba架构和图神经网络，通过熵基自适应融合策略整合局部空间关系和长程上下文依赖，用于全切片图像分析，在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在捕捉局部空间关系和长程上下文依赖方面存在局限。

Method: 集成Mamba架构（擅长捕捉长程全局依赖）和图神经网络（强调细粒度短程空间交互），引入基于熵的自适应融合策略，根据上下文重要性动态平衡两个分支的贡献。

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，SlideMamba的PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等方法，在ROC AUC、敏感性和特异性方面也表现优异。

Conclusion: 集成架构结合熵基自适应融合策略展现出强大性能，为计算病理学中的空间分辨预测建模任务提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

### [4] [Detecting gene-environment interactions to guide personalized intervention: boosting distributional regression for polygenic scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20850)
*Qiong Wu,Hannah Klinkhammer,Kiran Kunwar,Christian Staerk,Carlo Maj,Andreas Mayr*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 提出snpboostlss算法，通过高斯位置-尺度模型的循环梯度提升方法，同时构建表型均值和方差的稀疏多基因风险评分模型，用于识别基因-环境相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多基因风险评分方法主要关注表型均值建模，忽略了方差分析。与表型方差相关的遗传变异可以为基因-环境相互作用研究提供重要见解。

Method: 使用循环梯度提升算法构建高斯位置-尺度模型，在高维大规模基因型数据中，每个提升步骤仅考虑最相关的变异批次，以提高计算效率。

Result: 在英国生物银行队列中验证了他汀类药物使用与表型方差多基因风险评分的相互作用，发现他汀类药物的治疗效果在表型方差多基因风险评分较高的人群中更显著。应用于BMI时，新构建的方差多基因风险评分与体力活动和久坐行为存在显著相互作用。

Conclusion: snpboostlss推导的表型方差多基因风险评分有潜力识别那些能从环境变化（如医疗干预和生活方式改变）中获益更多的个体。

Abstract: Polygenic risk scores can be used to model the individual genetic liability
for human traits. Current methods primarily focus on modeling the mean of a
phenotype neglecting the variance. However, genetic variants associated with
phenotypic variance can provide important insights to gene-environment
interaction studies. To overcome this, we propose snpboostlss, a cyclical
gradient boosting algorithm for a Gaussian location-scale model to jointly
derive sparse polygenic models for both the mean and the variance of a
quantitative phenotype. To improve computational efficiency on high-dimensional
and large-scale genotype data (large n and large p), we only consider a batch
of most relevant variants in each boosting step. We investigate the effect of
statins therapy (the environmental factor) on low-density lipoprotein in the UK
Biobank cohort using the new snpboostlss algorithm. We are able to verify the
interaction between statins usage and the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic
variance in both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses. Particularly,
following the spirit of target trial emulation, we observe that the treatment
effect of statins is more substantial in people with higher polygenic risk
scores for phenotypic variance, indicating gene-environment interaction. When
applying to body mass index, the newly constructed polygenic risk scores for
variance show significant interaction with physical activity and sedentary
behavior. Therefore, the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance derived
by snpboostlss have potential to identify individuals that could benefit more
from environmental changes (e.g. medical intervention and lifestyle changes).

### [5] [Not All Accuracy Is Equal: Prioritizing Diversity in Infectious Disease Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21191)
*Carson Dudley,Marisa Eisenberg*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 疾病预测集成模型表现不佳的原因是模型间高度相关，建议关注模型多样性而非单纯增加数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管集成预测在疾病应对中广泛应用，但COVID-19和流感预测中集成模型仅比最佳单一模型提升1%，甚至经常排名低于单个模型，需要探究集成模型表现不佳的原因

Method: 分析模型开发者和集成构建者通常关注独立准确性，但大多数流行病预测基于相同方法和监测数据，导致高度相关的预测误差

Result: 模型间的高度相关性限制了集成的好处，解释了为什么大型集成有时只能带来边际收益

Conclusion: 要实现集成的潜力，模型开发者和集成构建者应优先选择提供互补信息的模型，构建真正多样化的集成，产生更稳健的预测

Abstract: Ensemble forecasts have become a cornerstone of large-scale disease response,
underpinning decision making at agencies such as the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). Their growing use reflects the goal of combining
multiple models to improve accuracy and stability versus using a single model.
However, recent experience shows these benefits are not guaranteed. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC's multi-model forecasting ensemble outperformed the
best single model by only 1%, and CDC flu forecasting ensembles have often
ranked below multiple individual models.
  This raises a key question: why are ensembles underperforming? We posit that
a central reason is that both model developers and ensemble builders typically
focus on stand-alone accuracy. Models are fit to minimize their own forecasting
error, and ensembles are often weighted according to those same scores.
However, most epidemic forecasts are built from a small set of approaches and
trained on the same surveillance data, leading to highly correlated errors.
This redundancy limits the benefit of ensembling and may explain why large
ensembles sometimes deliver only marginal gains.
  To realize the potential of ensembles, both modelers and ensemblers should
prioritize models that contribute complementary information rather than
replicating existing approaches. Ensembles built with this principle in mind
move beyond size for its own sake toward true diversity, producing forecasts
that are more robust and more valuable for epidemic preparedness and response.

### [6] [Data-driven Neural Networks for Windkessel Parameter Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21206)
*Benedikt Hoock,Tobias Köppl*

Main category: q-bio.TO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经网络的Windkessel参数校准方法，用于1D-0D耦合血流模型，通过模拟左臂动脉血压训练网络，能够高效模拟整个域的压力脉冲波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够有效校准Windkessel参数的方法，特别是在测量位置不精确或数据受噪声影响的情况下。

Method: 设计数据驱动的神经网络，在左臂动脉模拟血压上训练，然后通过添加虚拟神经元并仅在这些神经元上重新训练来校准WK参数。

Result: 神经网络能够以可忽略的误差和计算量模拟整个模拟域的压力脉冲波（时间、空间和变化的WK参数）。

Conclusion: 该方法在各种场景下（特别是测量位置未知或数据有噪声时）评估了其有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK)
parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this
end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood
pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the
pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space
and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To
calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by
dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is
to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly,
when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by
noise.

### [7] [A Genetic Algorithm for Navigating Synthesizable Molecular Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20719)
*Alston Lo,Connor W. Coley,Wojciech Matusik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynGA是一种直接在合成路径上操作的遗传算法，通过自定义交叉和变异算子约束分子设计的可合成性，并可结合机器学习过滤器提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受遗传算法有效性和分子设计中可合成性重要性的启发，开发能够直接操作合成路径并确保可合成性的算法。

Method: 使用自定义交叉和变异算子约束算法在可合成分子空间内操作，通过修改适应度函数适应不同设计任务，并可结合机器学习过滤器和贝叶斯优化。

Result: SynGA在可合成类似物搜索和样本效率属性优化等任务中表现有效，结合块过滤后达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SynGA不仅可作为强大的独立基线，还可作为多功能模块集成到更大的合成感知工作流程中。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.
