Abstract: Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain cancer, and the discovery of
molecular subgroups is enabling personalized treatment strategies. In 2019, a
consensus identified eight novel subtypes within Groups 3 and 4, each
displaying heterogeneous characteristics. Classifiers are essential for
translating these findings into clinical practice by supporting clinical
trials, personalized therapy development and application, and patient
monitoring. This study presents a DNA methylation-based, cross-platform machine
learning classifier capable of distinguishing these subtypes on both HM450 and
EPIC methylation array samples. Across two independent test sets, the model
achieved weighted F1 = 0.95 and balanced accuracy = 0.957, consistent across
platforms. As the first cross-platform solution, it provides backward
compatibility while extending applicability to a newer platform, also enhancing
accessibility. It also has the potential to become the first publicly available
classifier for these subtypes once deployed through a web application, as
planned in the future. This work overall takes steps in the direction of
advancing precision medicine and improving clinical outcomes for patients
within the majority prevalence medulloblastoma subgroups, groups 3 and 4.

TL;DR: 开发了一个可解释的多模态大语言模型，用于评估视神经头OCT环形扫描图像质量，并生成包含青光眼诊断和视网膜神经纤维层变薄评估的结构化临床报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要自动化的工具来筛查OCT图像质量并生成临床报告，以支持青光眼的诊断和评估。

Method: 使用Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct模型进行微调，训练数据包括配对的OCT图像和自动生成的结构化临床报告，描述全局和分区RNFL变薄情况。

Result: 模型在质量评估中准确率0.90，特异性0.98；青光眼检测准确率0.86；RNFL变薄预测准确率0.83-0.94；文本生成指标表现优异。

Conclusion: 微调后的MM-LLM能够基于OCT成像生成准确的临床描述，在图像质量识别和青光眼检测方面表现良好，为临床OCT评估提供支持。

Abstract: Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM)
that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2)
generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and
sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design:
Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH
OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and
ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was
fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data
included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical
reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans
were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model
was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment,
glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical
sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using
standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and
0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86
(sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction
accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and
temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference
reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1:
0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical
descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in
identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also
provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT
evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究通过自然实验发现低视力人群在都市导航中表现出不同的头眼协调模式：周边视野丧失者头眼运动分离，视力丧失者运动同步，中心视野丧失者模式独特。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统眼动研究在实验室固定头部条件下进行，无法了解真实环境中低视力人群的头眼协调情况，需要研究他们在自然导航中的运动模式。

Method: 设计自然主义"自由头部"实验，使用眼动追踪技术比较低视力人群与正常视力对照组的头眼运动模式。

Result: 周边视野丧失者表现出显著的头眼运动分离，视力丧失者运动更同步，中心视野丧失者结果不确定但显示独特运动模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现为康复策略、辅助移动技术和城市设计改进提供了有价值的方向，有助于开发增强低视力人群在复杂城市环境中安全性和独立性的干预措施。

Abstract: Low vision involves a range of visual impairments that significantly impact
daily activities, particularly navigation in urban environments. Individuals
with low vision often develop adaptive strategies to compensate for visual
deficits, relying on head movements to bring objects into their remaining
functional field of vision. Research suggests that they focus on road surface
markings and building edges to aid in wayfinding and collision avoidance.
However, urban navigation presents additional challenges, as obstacles, moving
hazards, and tripping dangers may enter their visual loss field, increasing the
risk of injury. Traditional eye movement studies are typically conducted in
controlled laboratory settings with fixed head positions, limiting the
understanding of head-eye coordination in real-world environments. To bridge
this gap, we designed a naturalistic, "free-head" experiment using eye-tracking
technology to examine head and eye movement patterns during urban navigation.
Participants with low vision were compared to a control cohort without visual
impairment to test the hypothesis that eye and head movements become decoupled
in visually impaired individuals. Findings indicate that individuals with
peripheral field loss exhibit significant eye-head decoupling, while those with
acuity loss demonstrate more synchronized movements. Results for individuals
with central field loss were inconclusive but revealed distinct movement
patterns. These insights provide valuable direction for rehabilitation
strategies, assistive-mobility technologies, and urban design improvements. By
expanding research on eye-head coordination, this study contributes to the
development of interventions that enhance safety, mobility, and independence
for individuals with low vision in complex urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经解剖与电刺激功能结果的关系对于优化神经接口设计至关重要，需要将电极配置与选择性肌肉募集联系起来。

Method: 在四只猪上进行急性实验，使用多触点神经外膜袖带电极对上肢神经进行电刺激，记录诱发肌电反应，并进行组织学分析神经束分布。

Result: 初步结果显示肌肉激活模式与神经束解剖结构之间存在关联，提供了电极配置与选择性肌肉募集的联系。

Conclusion: 这项研究有助于设计更有效的刺激策略，为神经调控和神经假体应用提供基础。

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional
outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface
design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which
epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb
nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously
identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked
electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle
recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation
patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves
were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular
organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the
combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one
animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by
linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately
contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic
applications.

Result: SAWHT是一种机制依赖的可重复方法，发现高BMI和红细胞甘油三酯与溶血敏感性增加相关，低SAWHT单位的红细胞显示氧化还原控制紊乱和色氨酸代谢缺陷。

Conclusion: SAW-HA平台具有作为输血医学即时检测工具的潜力，可实现精准输血医学方法。

Abstract: Blood transfusion remains a cornerstone of modern medicine, saving countless
lives daily. Yet the quality of transfused blood varies dramatically among
donors-a critical factor often overlooked in clinical practice. Rapid,
benchtop, and cost-effective methods for evaluating stored red blood cells
(RBCs) at the site of transfusion are lacking, with concerns persisting about
the association between metabolic signatures of stored RBC quality and
transfusion outcomes. Recent studies utilizing metabolomics approaches to
evaluate stored erythrocytes find that donor biology (e.g., genetics, age,
lifestyle factors) underlies the heterogeneity associated with blood storage
and transfusion. The appreciation of donor-intrinsic factors provides
opportunities for precision transfusion medicine approaches for the evaluation
of storage quality and prediction of transfusion efficacy. Here we propose a
new platform, the Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay (SAW-HA), for on-site
evaluation of stored RBCs utilizing SAW Hemolysis Temperature (SAWHT) as a
marker for RBC quality. We report SAWHT as a mechanism-dependent reproducible
methodology for evaluating stored human RBCs up to 42 days. Our results define
unique signatures for SAW hemolysis and metabolic profiles in RBCs from two of
the six donors in which high body mass index (BMI) and RBC triglycerides
associated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Metabolic age of the
stored RBCs - a recently appreciated predictor of post-transfusion
efficacy-reveal that RBCs from the two low SAWHT units were characterized by
disrupted redox control, deficient tryptophan metabolism, and high BMI.
Together, these findings indicate the potential of the SAW-HA as a
point-of-care analysis for transfusion medicine.

### [6] [Uncertainty-Guided Model Selection for Tabular Foundation Models in Biomolecule Efficacy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02476)
*Jie Li,Andrew McCarthy,Zhizhuo Zhang,Stephen Young*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于不确定性的模型选择策略，用于优化生物分子功效预测。通过选择预测不确定性最低的模型进行集成，在siRNA敲低功效任务中取得了优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子功效预测中很有前景，但其性能对提供的上下文高度敏感。如何在没有真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过模型预测的分位数间范围(IQR)作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成。

Result: 在siRNA敲低功效任务中，基于TabPFN的模型超越了专门的先进预测器。模型预测的IQR与真实预测误差呈负相关，选择平均IQR最低的模型集成获得了优于传统方法的性能。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是一种强大的、无需标签的启发式方法，可用于优化生物分子功效预测。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.
