Gene knockout has proven to be a\nfundamental technique in molecular biology, allowing the investigation of the\nfunction of specific genes in an organism, as well as in specific cell types.\nHowever, gene expression patterns are quite heterogeneous in single-cell\ntranscriptional data from a uniform environment, representing different cell\nstates, which produce cell-type and cell-specific gene knockout impacts. A\ncomputational method that can predict the single-cell resolution knockout\nimpact is still lacking. Here, we present a data-driven framework for learning\nthe mapping between gene expression profiles derived from gene assemblages,\nenabling the accurate prediction of perturbed expression profiles following\nknockout (KO) for any cell, without relying on prior perturbed data. We\nsystematically validated our framework using synthetic data generated from gene\nregulatory dynamics models, two mouse knockout single-cell datasets, and\nhigh-throughput in vitro CRISPRi Perturb-seq data. Our results demonstrate that\nthe framework can accurately predict both expression profiles and KO effects at\nthe single-cell level.

HMMs are discrete-time models, and most of their\noutputs strongly depend on the temporal resolution of data. We compile known\ntheoretical results about scale dependence in Markov chains and correlated\nrandom walks, which are the most common components of HMMs for animal movement.\nWe also illustrate this phenomenon using simulations covering a wide range of\nbiological scenarios.
