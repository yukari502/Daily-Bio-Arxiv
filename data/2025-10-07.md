### [1] [Predicting cell-specific gene expression profile and knockout impact through deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03359)
*Yongjian He,Vered Klein,Orr Levy,Xu-Wen Wang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动框架，用于预测单细胞分辨率下的基因敲除影响，无需依赖先前的扰动数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞转录组数据中基因表达模式具有异质性，现有方法无法预测单细胞分辨率的基因敲除影响。

Method: 通过从基因组合中学习基因表达谱之间的映射关系，准确预测任何细胞在基因敲除后的表达谱。

Result: 在合成数据、小鼠敲除单细胞数据集和高通量CRISPRi Perturb-seq数据上验证，框架能准确预测单细胞水平的表达谱和敲除效应。

Conclusion: 该框架为单细胞分辨率下推断基因功能提供了通用工具，为大规模实验筛选不可行情况下的遗传扰动研究提供了新机会。

Abstract: Gene expression data is essential for understanding how genes are regulated
and interact within biological systems, providing insights into disease
pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Gene knockout has proven to be a
fundamental technique in molecular biology, allowing the investigation of the
function of specific genes in an organism, as well as in specific cell types.
However, gene expression patterns are quite heterogeneous in single-cell
transcriptional data from a uniform environment, representing different cell
states, which produce cell-type and cell-specific gene knockout impacts. A
computational method that can predict the single-cell resolution knockout
impact is still lacking. Here, we present a data-driven framework for learning
the mapping between gene expression profiles derived from gene assemblages,
enabling the accurate prediction of perturbed expression profiles following
knockout (KO) for any cell, without relying on prior perturbed data. We
systematically validated our framework using synthetic data generated from gene
regulatory dynamics models, two mouse knockout single-cell datasets, and
high-throughput in vitro CRISPRi Perturb-seq data. Our results demonstrate that
the framework can accurately predict both expression profiles and KO effects at
the single-cell level. Our approach provides a generalizable tool for inferring
gene function at single-cell resolution, offering new opportunities to study
genetic perturbations in contexts where large-scale experimental screens are
infeasible.

### [2] [RawBench: A Comprehensive Benchmarking Framework for Raw Nanopore Signal Analysis Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03629)
*Furkan Eris,Ulysse McConnell,Can Firtina,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: RawBench是首个用于评估纳米孔原始信号分析技术的灵活框架，通过模块化评估三个核心组件：参考基因组编码、信号编码和表示匹配，证明原始信号分析在降低资源需求的同时能保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架存在三个主要问题：1) 忽略原始信号分析技术；2) 缺乏灵活性难以适应新工具；3) 未包含最新的纳米孔数据集改进。需要提供一个可扩展的基准测试框架来设计和比较新的原始信号分析方法。

Method: 开发RawBench框架，模块化评估三个核心组件：参考基因组编码（使用不同孔模型）、信号编码（通过各种分割方法）和表示匹配（通过不同数据结构）。在读取映射、读取分类和原始信号分析辅助的碱基识别三个任务上进行全面评估。

Result: 评估显示原始信号分析在显著降低资源需求的同时能够达到有竞争力的质量，特别是在需要实时处理或边缘部署的场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: RawBench提供了一个有效的基准测试框架，证明原始信号分析是资源密集型碱基识别方法的可行替代方案，特别适用于资源受限或需要实时处理的应用场景。

Abstract: Nanopore sequencing technologies continue to advance rapidly, offering
critical benefits such as real-time analysis, the ability to sequence extremely
long DNA fragments (up to millions of bases in a single read), and the option
to selectively stop sequencing a molecule before completion. Traditionally, the
raw electrical signals generated during sequencing are converted into DNA
sequences through a process called basecalling, which typically relies on large
neural network models. Raw signal analysis has emerged as a promising
alternative to these resource-intensive approaches. While attempts have been
made to benchmark conventional basecalling methods, existing evaluation
frameworks 1) overlook raw signal analysis techniques, 2) lack the flexibility
to accommodate new raw signal analysis tools easily, and 3) fail to include the
latest improvements in nanopore datasets. Our goal is to provide an extensible
benchmarking framework that enables designing and comparing new methods for raw
signal analysis. To this end, we introduce RawBench, the first flexible
framework for evaluating raw nanopore signal analysis techniques. RawBench
provides modular evaluation of three core pipeline components: 1) reference
genome encoding (using different pore models), 2) signal encoding (through
various segmentation methods), and 3) representation matching (via different
data structures). We extensively evaluate raw signal analysis techniques in
terms of 1) quality and performance for read mapping, 2) quality and
performance for read classification, and 3) quality of raw signal
analysis-assisted basecalling. Our evaluations show that raw signal analysis
can achieve competitive quality while significantly reducing resource
requirements, particularly in settings where real-time processing or edge
deployment is necessary.

### [3] [InstructPLM-mu: 1-Hour Fine-Tuning of ESM2 Beats ESM3 in Protein Mutation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03370)
*Junde Xu,Yapin Shi,Lijun Lang,Taoyong Cui,Zhiming Zhang,Guangyong Chen,Jiezhong Qiu,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出InstructPLM-mu微调框架，证明仅用序列预训练的蛋白质语言模型ESM2通过结构输入微调后，性能可媲美端到端训练的ESM3模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态蛋白质语言模型在突变效应预测中表现优异，但从头训练需要大量计算资源。研究能否通过微调预训练的序列模型达到类似性能。

Method: 系统比较三种不同的特征融合设计和微调方案，开发InstructPLM-mu微调框架。

Result: 实验表明，对ESM2进行结构输入微调可以达到与ESM3相当的性能，融合方法和调优策略对最终精度有显著影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作为将结构信息注入预训练蛋白质语言模型提供了实用指导，并激励进一步研究更好的融合机制和微调协议。

Abstract: Multimodal protein language models deliver strong performance on
mutation-effect prediction, but training such models from scratch demands
substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning
framework called InstructPLM-mu and try to answer a question: \textit{Can
multimodal fine-tuning of a pretrained, sequence-only protein language model
match the performance of models trained end-to-end? } Surprisingly, our
experiments show that fine-tuning ESM2 with structural inputs can reach
performance comparable to ESM3. To understand how this is achieved, we
systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning
recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy
strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not
trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure
into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on
better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.

### [4] [Scale dependence in hidden Markov models for animal movement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03958)
*Théo Michelot,Emma Storey*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 隐马尔可夫模型在动物运动分析中存在尺度依赖性问题，模型参数和状态分类都受到时间分辨率的影响，这限制了不规则时间间隔数据的分析和不同采样率数据的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究隐马尔可夫模型在动物运动分析中的尺度依赖性问题，因为HMM是离散时间模型，其输出强烈依赖于数据的时间分辨率，这会影响参数估计和状态分类的准确性。

Method: 通过编译马尔可夫链和相关随机游走理论结果，并进行涵盖广泛生物场景的模拟实验，来研究HMM的尺度依赖性。

Result: 尺度依赖性不仅影响所有模型参数（转移概率和运动参数），还影响运动模式到状态的总体分类，这凸显了在从分析结果得出结论时仔细考虑时间分辨率的重要性。

Conclusion: 虽然HMM仍然是研究动物运动和行为的宝贵工具，但必须充分理解其尺度依赖性的局限性，特别是在处理不规则时间间隔数据和不同采样率数据集时。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used increasingly to understand how
movement patterns of animals arise from behavioural states. An animal is
assumed to transition between behavioural states through time, as described by
transition probabilities. Within each state, the movement typically follows a
discrete-time random walk, where steps between successive observed locations
are described in terms of step lengths (related to speed) and turning angles
(related to tortuosity). HMMs are discrete-time models, and most of their
outputs strongly depend on the temporal resolution of data. We compile known
theoretical results about scale dependence in Markov chains and correlated
random walks, which are the most common components of HMMs for animal movement.
We also illustrate this phenomenon using simulations covering a wide range of
biological scenarios. The scale dependence affects not only all model
parameters, i.e., the transition probabilities and the movement parameters
within each behavioural state, but also the overall classification of movement
patterns into states. This highlights the importance of carefully considering
the time resolution when drawing conclusions from the results of analysis. In
addition, scale dependence generally precludes the analysis of tracking data
collected at irregular time intervals, and the comparison (or combination) of
data sets with different sampling rates. HMMs remain a valuable tool to answer
questions about animal movement and behaviour, as long as these limitations are
well understood.

### [5] [Inverse statistics of active matter trajectories to distinguish interaction kernel anisotropy from emergent correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04193)
*Simon F. Martina-Perez*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究通过推导线性偏微分方程连接可测量的两点速度相关性与未知的距离和角度依赖的相互作用核，解决了从群体运动数据中区分内在各向异性与涌现相关性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高分辨率成像数据中确定相互作用规律时，区分观察到的前后或侧向偏差是源于相互作用核的内在各向异性还是由各向同性成对相互作用力产生的涌现相关性，是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: 推导线性偏微分方程将可测量的两点速度相关性与未知的距离和角度依赖的相互作用核联系起来，通过图灵不稳定性分析各向同性相互作用如何产生各向异性模式。

Result: 发现即使代理按照角度无关的吸引-排斥规律相互作用，也可能出现偶极或四极模式。弱速度对齐力会抑制偶极模式的形成。

Conclusion: 该研究为实验设计提供了指导，帮助区分内在各向异性与涌现效应，并验证了各向同性相互作用产生各向异性模式的可能性。

Abstract: High-resolution imaging provides dense trajectories of migrating cells,
flocking animals, and synthetic active particles, from which interaction laws
can be determined with a wide variety of methods. Yet, distinguishing whether
front-back or lateral biases seen in such data reflect intrinsic anisotropy in
the interaction kernel or emergent correlations that are nevertheless produced
by isotropic pairwise interaction forces remains an open challenge. We resolve
this ambiguity by deriving a linear partial differential equation that connects
measurable two-point velocity correlations to an unknown, distance- and
angle-dependent interaction kernel. Turing-like instabilities can occur which
allows for dipolar or quadrupolar patterns to arise even when agents interact
according to an underlying attraction-repulsion law that is angle-independent.
We then show that incorporating a weak velocity-alignment force can interfere
with anisotropic pattern formation by suppressing dipolar patterns. We validate
these predictions with agent-based simulations and provide design guidance for
experiments that seek to discriminate intrinsic anisotropy from emergent
effects.

### [6] [TCR-EML: Explainable Model Layers for TCR-pMHC Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04377)
*Jiarui Li,Zixiang Yin,Zhengming Ding,Samuel J. Landry,Ramgopal R. Mettu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出TCR-EML方法，在蛋白质语言模型中加入可解释的原型层，用于预测TCR-pMHC结合，同时提供基于已知生化机制的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TCR-pMHC结合预测方法多为黑盒模型，无法提供预测依据，而事后解释方法不能明确建模已知结合机制。

Method: 在蛋白质语言模型骨干中集成可解释的原型层，这些原型基于已知TCR-pMHC结合机制中的氨基酸残基接触点。

Result: 在大规模数据集上表现出竞争力的预测准确性和泛化能力，在TCR-XAI基准测试中相比现有方法具有更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: TCR-EML方法既能保持高预测性能，又能提供基于生化机制的可解释性，为免疫相关研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is a
central component of adaptive immunity, with implications for vaccine design,
cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune disease. While recent advances in machine
learning have improved prediction of TCR-pMHC binding, the most effective
approaches are black-box transformer models that cannot provide a rationale for
predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods can provide insight with respect to
the input but do not explicitly model biochemical mechanisms (e.g. known
binding regions), as in TCR-pMHC binding. ``Explain-by-design'' models (i.e.,
with architectural components that can be examined directly after training)
have been explored in other domains, but have not been used for TCR-pMHC
binding. We propose explainable model layers (TCR-EML) that can be incorporated
into protein-language model backbones for TCR-pMHC modeling. Our approach uses
prototype layers for amino acid residue contacts drawn from known TCR-pMHC
binding mechanisms, enabling high-quality explanations for predicted TCR-pMHC
binding. Experiments of our proposed method on large-scale datasets demonstrate
competitive predictive accuracy and generalization, and evaluation on the
TCR-XAI benchmark demonstrates improved explainability compared with existing
approaches.

### [7] [Impact of Force Field Polarization on Correlated Motions of Proteins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04897)
*Ana Milinski,Annick Dejaegere,Roland Stote*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 比较了两种分子动力学模拟力场（非极化CHARMM 36m和极化Drude-2019）对蛋白质相关运动的影响，发现极化力场导致更大的残基波动和更弱的相关运动，以及更多天然接触的丧失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质的相关运动对生理功能至关重要，但不同力场对这些运动的影响尚未量化研究，特别是极化力场与非极化力场的对比。

Method: 使用两种力场（CHARMM 36m和Drude-2019）对泛素和PPARγ核受体进行经典MD模拟，分析残基波动、残基相关性图、社区网络分析和疏水簇分析。

Result: Drude-2019力场相比非极化力场产生更大的RMS波动、更弱的相关运动，以及更多的天然接触丧失。

Conclusion: 这是首次量化极化力场对相关运动计算研究的影响，为力场选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Correlated motions of proteins underpin many physiological mechanisms, such
as substrate binding, signal transduction, enzymatic activity and allostery.
These motions arise from low frequency collective movements of biomolecules and
have mostly been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present
the effects of two different empirical energy force fields used for molecular
dynamics simulations on correlated motions -- the non-polarizable CHARMM 36m
additive force field and the polarizable Drude-2019 force field. The study was
conducted on two proteins, ubiquitin - a small protein with a well-described
dynamic - and the nuclear receptor protein PPAR___. The ligand binding domain
of PPAR___ was of particular interest since its function is to regulate
transcription through ligand and coregulator protein binding. It has been
previously shown that a dynamical network of correlated motions ensures the
transmission of information related to PPAR___ ligand binding. We present the
results of classical MD simulations where we analyze the results in terms of
residue fluctuations, residue correlation maps, community network analysis and
hydrophobic cluster analysis. We find that RMS fluctuations tend to be greater
and correlated motions are less intense with Drude-2019 force field than with
the non-polarizable all atom additive force field. Analysis of large
hydrophobic clusters in the respective proteins show a greater loss of native
contacts in the simulations using the Drude-2019 force field than in the
simulations using the all atom force additive force field. Our results provide
the first quantification of the impact of using a polarizable force field in
computational studies that focus on correlated motions.

### [8] [Bridging Clinical Narratives and ACR Appropriateness Guidelines: A Multi-Agent RAG System for Medical Imaging Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04969)
*Satrio Pambudi,Filippo Menolascina*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多智能体认知架构，用于自动化将自由文本临床场景转化为符合指南的医学影像推荐，显著提高了指南应用的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于证据的医学影像指南（如ACR-AC）在临床实践中应用不足的问题，因为将非结构化患者叙述映射到结构化标准存在困难，导致患者预后不佳和医疗成本增加。

Method: 使用基于ColBERT的领域适应密集检索模型，在8,840个临床场景-推荐对的数据集上进行微调，然后通过LLM智能体序列进行选择和基于证据的合成。

Result: 在具有挑战性的测试集上实现了81%的精确匹配准确率和0.879的F1分数，比独立的GPT-4.1基线提高了67个百分点，检索器在top-10召回率达到93.9%。

Conclusion: 该多智能体认知架构能够有效自动化医学影像指南的应用，显著提高临床决策的准确性和效率，为前沿模型做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: The selection of appropriate medical imaging procedures is a critical and
complex clinical decision, guided by extensive evidence-based standards such as
the ACR Appropriateness Criteria (ACR-AC). However, the underutilization of
these guidelines, stemming from the difficulty of mapping unstructured patient
narratives to structured criteria, contributes to suboptimal patient outcomes
and increased healthcare costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multi-agent
cognitive architecture that automates the translation of free-text clinical
scenarios into specific, guideline-adherent imaging recommendations. Our system
leverages a novel, domain-adapted dense retrieval model, ColBERT, fine-tuned on
a synthetically generated dataset of 8,840 clinical scenario-recommendation
pairs to achieve highly accurate information retrieval from the ACR-AC
knowledge base. This retriever identifies candidate guidelines with a 93.9%
top-10 recall, which are then processed by a sequence of LLM-based agents for
selection and evidence-based synthesis. We evaluate our architecture using
GPT-4.1 and MedGemma agents, demonstrating a state-of-the-art exact match
accuracy of 81%, meaning that in 81% of test cases the predicted procedure set
was identical to the guideline's reference set, and an F1-score of 0.879. This
represents a 67-percentage-point absolute improvement in accuracy over a strong
standalone GPT-4.1 baseline, underscoring the contribution that our
architecture makes to a frontier model. These results were obtained on a
challenging test set with substantial lexical divergence from the source
guidelines. Our code is available at

### [9] [Robust multicellular programs dissect the complex tumor microenvironment and track disease progression in colorectal adenocarcinomas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05083)
*Loan Vulliard,Teresa Glauner,Sven Truxa,Miray Cetin,Yu-Le Wu,Ronald Simon,Laura Behm,Jovan Tanevski,Julio Saez-Rodriguez,Guido Sauter,Felix J. Hartmann*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究结合多重离子束成像和机器学习，分析了522个结直肠癌病变的单细胞代谢、功能和空间特征，揭示了肿瘤微环境在癌症进展中的协调重组模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌具有高度异质性，其进展不仅受肿瘤内在改变影响，还受肿瘤微环境重组影响。理解这些变化的协调机制可能揭示改变疾病进程的关键过程。

Method: 使用多重离子束成像(MIBI)结合机器学习，对522个结直肠癌病变进行单细胞分辨率分析，整合代谢、功能和空间特征。

Result: 发现了阶段特异性重组模式，包括淋巴-髓系细胞转变、基质-癌细胞协作和恶性代谢转变。空间组织比肿瘤内在改变或整体免疫浸润更能区分疾病阶段。

Conclusion: 开发了MuVIcell框架，将多模态特征浓缩为10个肿瘤微环境组织潜在因子，揭示了协调的多细胞程序，为靶向肿瘤微环境重组提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, with five-year survival
rates dropping from $\sim$90% in localized disease to $\sim$15% with distant
metastases. Disease progression is shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic
alterations but also by the reorganization of the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Metabolic, compositional, and spatial changes contribute to this progression,
but considered individually they lack context and often fail as therapeutic
targets. Understanding their coordination could reveal processes to alter the
disease course. Here, we combined multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) with
machine learning to profile metabolic, functional and spatial states of 522
colorectal lesions with single-cell resolution. We observed recurrent
stage-specific remodeling marked by a lymphoid-to-myeloid shift, stromal-cancer
cooperation, and malignant metabolic shifts. Spatial organization of
epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments provided stronger stratification
of disease stage than tumor-intrinsic changes or bulk immune infiltration
alone. To systematically model these coordinated changes, we condensed
multimodal features into 10 latent factors of TME organization. These factors
tracked disease progression, were conserved across cohorts, and revealed
frequent multicellular metabolic niches and distinct, non-exclusive TME
trajectories. Our framework MuVIcell exposes the elements that together drive
CRC progression by grouping co-occurring changes across cell types and feature
classes into coordinated multicellular programs. This creates a rational basis
to therapeutically target TME reorganization. Importantly, the framework is
scalable and flexible, offering a resource for studying multicellular
organization in other solid tumors.

### [10] [ModernBERT + ColBERT: Enhancing biomedical RAG through an advanced re-ranking retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04757)
*Eduardo Martínez Rivera,Filippo Menolascina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段检索架构，结合ModernBERT进行高效初始检索和ColBERTv2进行精细重排序，在生物医学RAG系统中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统的有效性受限于检索模块性能，通用检索器在专业领域表现不佳，而领域内模型计算成本过高，需要平衡效率与准确性。

Method: 开发两阶段检索架构：使用轻量级ModernBERT双向编码器进行初始候选检索，再用ColBERTv2延迟交互模型进行细粒度重排序，在PubMedQA上微调IR模块。

Result: ColBERT重排序器将Recall@3提升了4.2个百分点；在MIRAGE问答基准的五个任务上达到0.4448的平均准确率，优于MedCPT等基线模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段检索架构在生物医学RAG中表现优异，但性能关键依赖于检索器和重排序器的联合微调过程，否则重排序器可能降低性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually
grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by
the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically
misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated
response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced
language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is
often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to
address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval
architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for
efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model
for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our
retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical
context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from
PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of
the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points
compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical
RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on
the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong
baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this
performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns
the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the
performance.

### [11] [Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets For mRNA Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03811)
*Aya Laajil,Abduragim Shtanchaev,Sajan Muhammad,Eric Moulines,Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets (CAGFN)，通过整合课程学习和多目标GFlowNets来生成mRNA序列，使用基于长度的课程策略逐步增加序列长度，在mRNA设计任务中提升Pareto性能和生物合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mRNA序列设计面临巨大组合空间和多个目标优化的挑战，现有GFlowNets训练受到稀疏、长视野奖励和多目标权衡的限制。

Method: CAGFN整合长度课程学习，逐步调整最大序列长度引导探索；提供新的mRNA设计环境，结合目标蛋白序列和生物目标训练模型。

Result: 在不同mRNA设计任务中，CAGFN提高了Pareto性能和生物合理性，保持多样性；比无课程学习的GFlowNets更快达到更高质量解，并能泛化到分布外序列。

Conclusion: CAGFN为治疗性序列设计提供了生物动机设置，推进了GFlowNets在mRNA设计中的应用。

Abstract: Designing mRNA sequences is a major challenge in developing next-generation
therapeutics, since it involves exploring a vast space of possible nucleotide
combinations while optimizing sequence properties like stability, translation
efficiency, and protein expression. While Generative Flow Networks are
promising for this task, their training is hindered by sparse, long-horizon
rewards and multi-objective trade-offs. We propose Curriculum-Augmented
GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi-objective
GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length-based
curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding
exploration from easier to harder subproblems. We also provide a new mRNA
design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a
combination of biological objectives, allows for the training of models that
generate plausible mRNA candidates. This provides a biologically motivated
setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in therapeutic sequence design. On
different mRNA design tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological
plausibility, while maintaining diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches
higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence
sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution
sequences.

### [12] [Flow-Matching Based Refiner for Molecular Conformer Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04878)
*Xiangyang Xu,Hongyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于低能量分子构象生成的流匹配精炼器，通过从上游去噪模型的混合质量输出初始化采样并重新调度噪声尺度来绕过低信噪比阶段，从而提高样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去噪方法（如扩散和流匹配）在采样过程中，特别是在难以训练的低信噪比步骤中，容易受到误差累积的影响。

Method: 使用流匹配精炼器，从上游去噪模型的混合质量输出初始化采样，并重新调度噪声尺度以绕过低信噪比阶段。

Result: 在GEOM-QM9和GEOM-Drugs基准数据集上，生成器-精炼器管道以更少的总去噪步骤提高了质量，同时保持了多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过绕过低信噪比阶段，有效解决了去噪方法在分子构象生成中的误差累积问题，提高了样本质量。

Abstract: Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet
challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include
diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base
distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches
often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR
steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a
flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes
sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and
reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving
sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the
generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps
while preserving diversity.

Motivation: 理解微观基因型如何映射到宏观表型是生物学的核心问题，研究旨在建立发育过程的统计力学框架，将发育视为非平衡态之间的热力学转变。

Method: 应用多种信息论度量方法分析果蝇胚胎发育过程中的公开转录组数据集，主要使用索引集合的排列熵（PI熵）来测量转录组动态的信息复杂性。

Result: 研究发现转录组动态的信息复杂性显示出不可逆特征，PI熵的动态与发育阶段密切相关，表明基因表达的全局时间动态概率性地引导胚胎跨越宏观表型阶段。

Conclusion: 这是将信息复杂性分析应用于联系生物标志物的统计力学与宏观发育动态的测试案例，为理解发育过程提供了新的统计力学视角。

Abstract: The development of multicellular organisms entails a deep connection between
time-dependent biochemical processes taking place at the subcellular level, and
the resulting macroscopic phenotypes that arise in populations of up to
trillions of cells. A statistical mechanics of developmental processes would
help to understand how microscopic genotypes map onto macroscopic phenotypes, a
general goal across biology. Here we follow this approach, hypothesizing that
development should be understood as a thermodynamic transition between
non-equilibrium states. We test this hypothesis in the context of the fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism used widely in genetics and
developmental biology for over a century. Applying a variety of
information-theoretic measures to public transcriptomics datasets of whole fly
embryos during development, we show that the global temporal dynamics of gene
expression can be understood as a process that probabilistically guides
embryonic dynamics across macroscopic phenotypic stages. In particular, we
demonstrate signatures of irreversibility in the information complexity of
transcriptomic dynamics, as measured mainly by the permutation entropy of
indexed ensembles (PI entropy). Our results show that the dynamics of PI
entropy correlate strongly with developmental stages. Overall, this is a test
case in applying information complexity analysis to relate the statistical
mechanics of biomarkers to macroscopic developmental dynamics.

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.
