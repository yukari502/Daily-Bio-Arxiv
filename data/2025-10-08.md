### [1] [Heterogeneous immune recovery after viral response through a dynamical model of feedback-driven persistence and clearance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05161)
*Xiaoxin Wang,Kai Kang,Leyi Zhang,Changjing Zhuge*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一个包含六个模块的常微分方程模型来研究病毒感染中的免疫反应动力学，揭示了多稳态和不同健康状态共存的现象，以及免疫反应的复杂时间尺度特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病毒感染引发复杂的免疫反应，其异质性结果由非线性反馈塑造，需要建立理论框架来分析免疫反应和慢性疾病风险。

Method: 建立包含病毒载量、先天免疫、细胞免疫、体液免疫、免疫抑制和IL-6水平的六个模块的常微分方程模型，进行分岔分析和数值模拟。

Result: 在持续病毒暴露下，系统可表现出多达五个稳定平衡点；有限时间暴露显示多时间尺度恢复特征；病毒复制率在急性到慢性转变中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 该工作通过反馈动力学建模建立了分析免疫反应和慢性风险的理论框架，为干预策略提供了见解。

Abstract: Viral infections trigger complex immune responses with heterogeneous outcomes
shaped by nonlinear feedbacks. An ordinary differential equation model is
developed to investigate immune response dynamics during viral infection,
incorporating six modules: viral load, innate immunity, cellular immunity,
humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 levels. Bifurcation analysis
reveals that under continuous viral exposure, when viral clearance rate and
intrinsic viral death rate satisfy specific conditions, the system exhibits up
to five stable equilibria. This indicates that different health and disease
states may coexist depending on initial conditions, while severe inflammation
mainly arises from strong activation of cellular immunity, highlighting the
complexity of immune responses. Simulations of finite-time viral exposure
demonstrate multi-timescale recovery characteristics: viral load and IL-6
levels decline rapidly, whereas humoral immune activation and immunosuppression
show delayed and sustained patterns. Furthermore, analysis of infectious period
and disease duration also indicates that during transition from early acute
response to chronic disease, viral replication rate plays a critical role,
while immune response intensity is sensitive to both viral clearance and immune
self-activation. Subsystem analysis identifies the three-component subsystem of
viral load, innate immunity, and cellular immunity as core drivers of
bistability and oscillations, while humoral immunity, immune suppression, and
IL-6 primarily modulate response amplitude and timing. This work establishes a
theoretical framework for analyzing immune response and chronic risks through
feedback dynamical modelling, providing insights for intervention strategies.

### [2] [Aneurysm Growth Time Series Reconstruction Using Physics-informed Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05183)
*Jiacheng Wu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种从患者参数直接重建动脉瘤生长时间序列的方法，通过自编码器获取时间序列的紧凑表示，并用五层神经网络学习从患者参数到时间序列表示的映射。还引入了基于物理的约束来改进重建结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤破裂是导致发病率和死亡率的主要原因，但动脉瘤生长时间序列由于时间跨度长而难以获取。因此需要直接从患者参数预测动脉瘤生长历史。

Method: 使用自编码器获取时间序列的紧凑表示，然后用五层神经网络学习从患者参数到时间序列表示的映射。引入基于物理的约束作为自编码器优化问题的约束条件。

Result: 在无误差训练数据下，加入物理模型信息不会显著改善重建结果；但在有噪声和偏差误差的训练数据下，加入物理约束能显著改善预测时间序列。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从患者参数有效重建动脉瘤生长时间序列，特别是在有噪声数据的情况下，物理约束的引入能显著提升重建质量。

Abstract: Arterial aneurysm (Fig.1) is a bulb-shape local expansion of human arteries,
the rupture of which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US.
Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance
for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm
rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history.
However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of
aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to
reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters.
The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm
growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient
aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact
representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned
from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time
series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output
layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the
time series.
  Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism
of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior
physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization
problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and
differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model
information about the data will not significantly improve the time series
reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case
of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model
constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series.

### [3] [Harmonic fields and the mechanical response of a cellular monolayer to ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05193)
*Oliver E. Jensen,Christopher K. Revell*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散外微积分的框架来分析单层细胞组织的微分算子，并应用于研究细胞消融后的力学响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多细胞组织（如发育胚胎上的上皮组织）通常具有复杂的组织形状和细胞空间排列的异质性。现有的离散近似方法（如细胞顶点模型）可以容纳这些几何特征，但分析技术尚不完善。

Method: 在离散外微积分框架下表达单层细胞网络上的微分算子，定义适用于无序单层细胞的Hodge星算子、楔积和音乐同构，并使用包含渗透效应的顶点模型计算单层细胞在堵塞状态下的力学响应。

Result: 消融单层细胞产生的谐波矢量场振幅上界近似按1/r缩放；扰动位移表现出长程相干性、单极和四极特征，以及近似1/r的近孔上界缩放；扰动应力振幅上界近似按1/r²缩放。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析复杂细胞组织的力学行为提供了有效工具，揭示了细胞消融后力学响应的长程特征，对长程力学信号传导具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multicellular tissues, such as the epithelium coating a developing embryo,
often combine complex tissue shapes with heterogeneity in the spatial
arrangement of individual cells. Discrete approximations, such as the cell
vertex model, can accommodate these geometric features, but techniques for
analysis of such models are underdeveloped. Here, we express differential
operators defined on a network representing a monolayer of confluent cells in
the framework of discrete exterior calculus, considering scalar fields defined
over cell vertices and centres and vector fields defined over cell edges. We
achieve this by defining Hodge stars, wedge products and musical isomorphisms
that are appropriate for a disordered monolayer for which cell edges and links
between cell centres are not orthogonal, as is generic for epithelia. We use
this framework to evaluate the harmonic vector field arising in an ablated
monolayer, demonstrating an approximate 1/\textit{r} scaling of the upper bound
of the field's amplitude, where \textit{r} is the distance from the ablation.
Using a vertex model that incorporates osmotic effects, we then calculate the
mechanical response of a monolayer in a jammed state to ablation. Perturbation
displacements exhibit long-range coherence, monopolar and quadrupolar features,
and an approximate 1/\textit{r} near-hole upper-bound scaling, implicating the
harmonic field. The upper bounds on perturbation stress amplitudes scale
approximately like 1/\textit{r}$^2$, a feature relevant to long-range
mechanical signalling.

### [4] [Reinforcement Learning for Clinical Reasoning: Aligning LLMs with ACR Imaging Appropriateness Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05194)
*Anni Tziakouri,Filippo Menolascina*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于强化学习的推理代理MedReason-Embed，用于自动化医学影像转诊推荐，显著提升临床推理能力并超越更大模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中不必要检查程序增加的问题，这些程序使患者暴露于辐射和压力，限制公平获取，并给医疗系统带来压力。

Method: 使用强化学习（特别是组相对策略优化GRPO）训练推理代理，结合PubMed证据检索，开发模块化端到端代理架构来自动化影像转诊流程。

Result: 轻量级8B模型MedReason-Embed比基线提升18%的宏观F1分数，显示出更强的推理对齐性，并优于更大和替代训练模型。

Conclusion: 基于推理的监督能够实现高效、可信的临床AI，推理聚焦的强化学习在代理架构中具有提供透明、可扩展和可靠临床决策支持的潜力。

Abstract: Medical imaging has revolutionized diagnosis, yet unnecessary procedures are
rising, exposing patients to radiation and stress, limiting equitable access,
and straining healthcare systems. The American College of Radiology
Appropriateness Criteria, developed through extensive multidisciplinary review,
provide evidence-based guidance but remain underutilized. Leveraging advances
in LLM reasoning, we introduce a Reasoning Agent trained with Reinforcement
Learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to
replicate expert clinical reasoning from the ACR Criteria. We present a novel
RL approach for structured medical reasoning, systematically comparing
reasoning-focused reward functions and evidence integration strategies. Our
lightweight 8B model, MedReason-Embed, improves macro F1 by 18% over baseline,
shows stronger reasoning alignment, and outperforms both larger and
alternatively trained models, showing that reasoning-based supervision enables
efficient, trustworthy clinical AI. Building on this, we design a modular
end-to-end agentic architecture that automates imaging referrals: mapping
diagnoses to ICD codes, retrieving PubMed evidence, and recommending optimal
procedures. Crucially, the ability to generalize beyond static ACR guidelines
not only enables clinicians to handle out-of-distribution cases, but also
supports scaling the guideline development process itself, potentially reducing
the significant effort required to create and update them. This work shows the
potential of reasoning-focused RL within agentic architectures to deliver
transparent, scalable, and reliable clinical decision support. Our code is

### [5] [Reducing Latency and Noise in PPG-Based SpO2 Measurements: A Kalman Filtering Approach Towards Acute Hypoxia Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05355)
*Saud Lingawi,Garrett Frank,Benedictus H. Kartawidjaja,Mahsa Khalili,Brian Kwon,Calvin Kuo*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种结合传统PPG血氧饱和度估计方法和卡尔曼滤波的新方法，能够有效降低PPG信号噪声，在保持血氧动态变化的同时减少测量延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光电容积脉搏波描记法(PPG)在监测心肺健康方面广泛应用，但其信号易受身体运动和皮肤接触等因素干扰，导致血氧饱和度(SpO2)测量噪声较大。

Method: 将传统的PPG波形血氧饱和度估计方法与从PPG波形中提取SpO2变化的新方法相结合，在卡尔曼滤波器中进行处理。

Result: 卡尔曼滤波器将SpO2变异性从12.59%降低到4.30%，与30秒窗口平均法的4.73%相当，但延迟时间从14秒减少到3秒以内。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在降低噪声的同时保持SpO2的动态特性，特别适用于检测临床上重要但短暂的低氧状态，如呼吸暂停期间观察到的状态。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a common tool for monitoring cardiopulmonary
health. Relying on absorption or reflectance of light by hemoglobin in the
blood, the measured PPG waveform can be analyzed per heart beat using
physiological assumptions to extract metrics ranging from heart rate to
specific blood oxygenation (SpO2). This has led to the widespread use of PPG
for bedside clinical monitoring to wearable consumer health monitoring.
However, PPG is notoriously noisy and the measured absorption or reflectance of
light is sensitive to factors such as body movement and contact with the skin.
To reduce the noise in the PPG-derived SpO2, we developed combined traditional
methods of estimating SpO2 from the PPG waveform with a new method to extract
changes in SpO2 from the PPG waveform in a Kalman filter, and demonstrated its
ability to better estimate SpO2 in humans undergoing controlled hypoxia (down
to 14% atmospheric oxygen). The Kalman filter reduced variability in SpO2 to
4.30%SpO2 compared to the beat-to-beat SpO2 variability of 12.59%SpO2. This
mirrored current methods of window-averaging the beat-to-beat SpO2, with a 30s
window-average reducing SpO2 variability to 4.73%. However, current
window-average methods also introduce delays, with 10s and 30s window-averaging
introducing delays of 5s and 14s respectively compared to the beat-to-beat
SpO2. The Kalman filter reduced this delay to within 3s of the beat-to-beat
SpO2, highlighting its ability to reduce noise while maintaining SpO2 dynamics.
This capability is particularly useful in reliably detecting clinically
meaningful, but transient, hypoxic states, such as those observed during apnea.

TL;DR: 本文综述了物理信息机器学习(PIML)在生物医学领域的应用，重点介绍了PINNs、NODEs和神经算子三类框架，强调其在物理可解释性、数据稀缺和系统复杂性方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒学习方法在生物医学建模中存在局限性，需要整合物理定律与数据驱动方法来解决物理可解释性、数据稀缺和复杂系统建模的挑战。

Method: 系统回顾三类PIML框架：物理信息神经网络(PINNs)嵌入控制方程，神经常微分方程(NODEs)提供连续时间建模，神经算子学习函数空间映射。

Result: PIML已成功应用于生物固体/流体力学、力学生物学、医学成像、生理系统动力学、药代动力学和细胞信号传导等多个生物医学领域。

Conclusion: PIML在生物医学领域具有巨大潜力，未来需解决不确定性量化、泛化能力以及与大型语言模型集成等开放挑战。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at
https://github.com/JuBiotech/acia-workflows.

*David F. Anderson,Jingyi Ma,Praful Gagrani*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 本文使用严格数学方法研究共聚过程的随机模型，推导了物理文献中的结果，并推广到有限单体类型的共聚过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究共聚过程中关于瞬态性、零常返性和正常返性的标准，以及在瞬态状态下不同单体类型的极限比例和聚合物生长速度

Method: 使用严格的数学论证方法，而非物理文献中的启发式方法

Result: 推导了物理文献中的结果，并将技术推广到有限单体类型的共聚过程

Conclusion: 开发的数学方法为未来研究更复杂模型提供了基础

Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been
extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of
interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence,
and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the
transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer
types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the
polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these
questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical
arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the
techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process
with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used
and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex
models in the future.
