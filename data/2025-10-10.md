### [1] [Decoding the dark proteome: Deep learning-enabled discovery of druggable enzymes in Wuchereria bancrofti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07337)
*Shawnak Shivakumar,Jefferson Hernandez*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一种计算流程，将斑氏丝虫未注释的蛋白质序列转化为精确的四级EC酶分类号和候选药物，发现了14,772个新注释蛋白质和543个新EC类别，并确定了6个有前景的药物靶点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 斑氏丝虫导致淋巴丝虫病，影响全球数亿人，但90%以上的蛋白质组缺乏功能注释，阻碍了药物发现。

Method: 使用DEtection TRansformer预测酶功能概率，在4,476个标记寄生虫蛋白上微调分层最近邻EC预测器，应用拒绝采样保留100%置信度的四级EC分类，并通过多标准筛选优先靶点。

Result: 为14,772个未表征蛋白质分配了精确EC号，发现543个新EC类别，确定了6个优先靶点，所有靶点预测结合亲和力低于1微摩尔，其中部分达到纳摩尔级别。

Conclusion: 该研究首次大规模绘制了斑氏丝虫暗蛋白质组的功能图谱，为早期药物开发提供了重要基础，但实验验证仍是必要的。

Abstract: Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic
filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million
at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack
of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark
proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present
a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino
acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and
drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the
probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor
EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling
to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This
pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized
proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A
qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical
tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized
six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall
inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune
interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound
library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein
conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong
predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs
against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing
promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental
validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale
functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage
drug development for the species.

### [2] [Mitigating Surgical Data Imbalance with Dual-Prediction Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07345)
*Danush Kumar Venkatesh,Adam Schmidt,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal,Omid Mohareri*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: SurgiFlowVid是一个稀疏可控的视频扩散框架，用于生成手术视频中代表性不足的类别，通过联合去噪RGB帧和光流来改善运动建模，使用稀疏视觉编码器实现可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频数据集通常存在严重不平衡问题，罕见动作和工具代表性不足，这限制了下游模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出双预测扩散模块联合去噪RGB帧和光流，引入稀疏视觉编码器基于轻量信号（如稀疏分割掩码或RGB帧）控制生成过程。

Result: 在三个手术数据集上的验证显示，该方法生成的数据在动作识别、工具存在检测和腹腔镜运动预测任务中比基线方法提升10-20%。

Conclusion: SurgiFlowVid是缓解数据不平衡和推进手术视频理解方法的有前景策略。

Abstract: Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling
procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are
often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which
limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with
$SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for
generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach
introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames
and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion
modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions
the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks
or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate
our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action
recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction.
Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over
competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to
mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.

### [3] [Learning from Limited Multi-Phase CT: Dual-Branch Prototype-Guided Framework for Early Recurrence Prediction in HCC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07347)
*Hsin-Pei Yu,Si-Qin Lyu,Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Weichung Wang,Tung-Hung Su,Jia-Horng Kao,Che Lin*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出DuoProto双分支原型引导框架，通过利用有限多期相数据增强单期相CT的早期复发预测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肝癌切除术后早期复发预测中多期相CT数据不完整的现实问题，弥合理想模型假设与实际部署约束之间的差距

Method: 采用双分支架构：主分支处理单期相图像，辅助分支利用可用多期相扫描通过跨域原型对齐指导表示学习，结合基于排名的监督机制

Result: 在类别不平衡和缺失期相条件下优于现有方法，消融研究验证了双分支原型引导设计的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架符合当前临床应用需求，为HCC复发风险预测提供了通用解决方案，支持更明智的决策制定

Abstract: Early recurrence (ER) prediction after curative-intent resection remains a
critical challenge in the clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full
multi-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely
performed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently
available across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV)
scans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging
resources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such
as contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a
mismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of
real-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively
leverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a
Dual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction
from single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training.
DuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes
single-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase
scans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment.
Structured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature
discrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates
clinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance
and missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design. Our framework aligns
with current clinical application needs and provides a general solution for
recurrence risk prediction in HCC, supporting more informed decision-making.

### [4] [Quantification of protein homodimer affinity using native mass spectrometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08324)
*Jonathan Schulte,Eric Schwegler,Ute A. Hellmich,Nina Morgner*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种基于定量激光诱导液体珠离子解吸质谱（qLILBID-MS）的新方法，用于准确测定蛋白质同源二聚体的解离常数（KD），克服了传统质谱在分析同源寡聚体时信号重叠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物过程依赖于生物大分子间的精确相互作用，解离常数（KD）的测定在基础研究和药物开发中至关重要。现有方法如等温滴定量热法需要大量样品，而传统质谱法在分析同源寡聚体时存在信号重叠问题。

Method: 通过样品稀释和共价交联，分别分析每个寡聚物种的电荷状态分布，从而解析单体/二聚体对重叠质谱峰的贡献，使用qLILBID-MS技术进行定量分析。

Result: qLILBID-MS准确测定了牛血清白蛋白和锥虫氧化还原酶Tryparedoxin的同源二聚体亲和力，能够监测通过突变关键二聚体界面接触点导致的亲和力逐渐降低。该方法仅需其他方法（如等温滴定量热法）一小部分样品量。

Conclusion: qLILBID-MS是一种灵敏、稳健、快速、可扩展且经济高效的蛋白质相互作用定量方法，可加速当代药物发现工作流程，特别是用于筛选邻近诱导分子如蛋白降解靶向嵌合体和分子胶。

Abstract: Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions
between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by
the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must
be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal
method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large
range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require
labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity
of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but
typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass
signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to
overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of
each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.
Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead
Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the
affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of
Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei
parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently,
qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as
isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein
homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the
gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface
contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and
cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can
accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening
for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and
molecular glues.

### [5] [Large-scale spatial variable gene atlas for spatial transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07653)
*Jiawen Chen,Jinwei Zhang,Dongshen Peng,Yutong Song,Aitong Ruan,Yun Li,Didong Li*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 对20种最先进的空间可变基因检测方法进行综合基准测试，构建首个跨组织SVG图谱，分析癌症和正常组织中的空间基因程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着空间转录组学技术的发展，准确识别不同平台、组织类型和疾病背景下的SVG既是重大机遇也是计算挑战。

Method: 使用STimage-1K4M资源中的662张人类组织切片，评估20种SVG检测方法在生物学和技术标准上的表现。

Result: 发现性能因组织类型、空间分辨率和研究设计而异；构建了跨组织SVG图谱，揭示了与发育和功能关系相关的组织间相似性。

Conclusion: 建立了评估和解释空间基因表达框架，为ST社区提供了参考资源。

Abstract: Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue
architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial
transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs
across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a
major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a
comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods
using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data
comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method
across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including
recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide
reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to
technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance
depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond
benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling
comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues.
We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and
functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node,
and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune
infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work
defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and
establishes a reference resource for the ST community.

### [6] [Evaluating multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation fitted to heterogeneous datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08151)
*André Luís Luza,Didier Alard,Frédéric Barraquand*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 多季节占用模型在考虑空间和时间自相关时，对异构数据和协变量重叠具有鲁棒性，但在存在严重数据缺失时会出现可识别性问题，导致预测偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生态学中物种分布预测时，由于缺乏重复观测数据导致模型可识别性不足的问题，特别是在高度异构数据集（缺失数据或单次访问数据占主导）中的表现。

Method: 使用包含空间和时间随机效应的多季节占用模型，评估其在调查次数偏态分布、占用和检测子模型协变量重叠、以及观测时空聚类等情况下的性能。

Result: 模型对异构数据和协变量重叠具有鲁棒性，但当添加时空数据缺口时，站点占用率偏向平均占用率且被高估。随机效应未能纠正缺口的影响，因为方差和自相关参数存在可识别性问题。

Conclusion: 具有自相关的多季节占用模型对异构数据和协变量重叠具有鲁棒性，但仍存在可识别性问题，严重的数据缺口会损害预测准确性，即使在数据丰富的区域也是如此。

Abstract: Predicting species distributions using occupancy models accounting for
imperfect detection is now commonplace in ecology. Recently, modelling spatial
and temporal autocorrelation was proposed to alleviate the lack of replication
in occupancy data, which often prevents model identifiability. However, how
such models perform in highly heterogeneous datasets where missing or
single-visit data dominates remains an open question. Motivated by an
heterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the
performance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random
effects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site,
overlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and
spatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is
robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when
spatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average
occupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence
of gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation
parameters. Occupancy analysis of two butterfly species further confirmed these
results. Overall, multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation are robust
to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap, but still present identifiability
issues and are challenged by severe data gaps, which compromise predictions
even in data-rich areas.

### [7] [PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07964)
*Jiabei Cheng,Changxi Chi,Jingbo Zhou,Hongyi Xin,Jun Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PRESCRIBE框架，用于单细胞扰动预测中联合估计模型不确定性和数据不确定性，通过置信评分提高预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测需要同时考虑模型不确定性和数据不确定性，因为基因扰动是随机生化过程，预测可靠性对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 采用多元深度证据回归框架，联合测量两种不确定性来源，为每个预测生成置信评分。

Result: PRESCRIBE能有效估计与经验准确性强相关的置信评分，相比基线方法实现超过3%的稳定准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够识别不可靠预测结果，提高单细胞扰动预测的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

TL;DR: 开发了无毒可摄入的机械传感器（微测力计），用于定量研究管腔结构中的力，并在活体秀丽隐杆线虫中应用于摄食研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然存在非侵入性电生理技术，但大多数机械传感器无法非侵入性地访问管腔结构，因此需要开发能够定量研究管腔内力的工具。

Method: 使用嵌入聚苯乙烯微球中的NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4上转换纳米粒子作为光学微测力计，结合光学显微镜和原子力显微镜进行体外研究。

Result: 力引起发射红光与绿光比值的线性无滞后变化；成年秀丽隐杆线虫在摄食时产生约10微牛顿的咬合力，且力生成的时间模式与摄食器官的肌肉活动一致。

Conclusion: 微测力计有潜力实现定量研究，探索衰老、基因突变和药物治疗如何影响该器官及其他管腔器官的神经肌肉应力。

Abstract: The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food
and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although
non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist, most mechanosensors cannot
access luminal structures non-invasively. Here we introduce non-toxic
ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces
and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms.
These optical 'microgauges' comprise NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 upconverting
nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical
microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show
that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted
red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive
electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during
feeding on the order of 10 micronewtons and that the temporal pattern of force
generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the
bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure
range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm. Microgauges have the
potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular
stresses are affected by aging, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this
organ and other luminal organs.

*Jianzhe Wei,Jingwen Zhu,Pan Chu,Liang Luo,Xiongfei Fu*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 首次在合成细菌基因电路中单细胞水平观测到状态转变，发现转变过程不符合经典Kramers理论的小噪声假设，缺乏单一特征速率，存在显著乘性噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物系统中的状态转变是基础但难以直接观测的过程，需要开发新的实验和理论方法来理解这些转变机制。

Method: 使用mother machine装置追踪1007个细胞超过27小时，采用首通分析和动力学重构方法。

Result: 观测到状态转变发生在小噪声区域之外，缺乏单一特征速率，存在显著乘性噪声，这些噪声扭曲了有效势能景观但增加了转变时间。

Conclusion: 需要超越小噪声假设的理论框架来描述生物状态转变过程。

Abstract: State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to
observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state
transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine,
we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical
reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime,
challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a
single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between
discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts
the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These
findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions
beyond the small-noise assumption.
