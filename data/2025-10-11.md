### [1] [Decoding the dark proteome: Deep learning-enabled discovery of druggable enzymes in Wuchereria bancrofti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07337)
*Shawnak Shivakumar,Jefferson Hernandez*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一个计算管道，将W. bancrofti的未注释氨基酸序列数据转化为精确的四级酶委员会编号和药物候选物，为淋巴丝虫病的药物发现提供了新靶点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: W. bancrofti是导致淋巴丝虫病的寄生虫，影响全球数亿人。超过90%的W. bancrofti暗蛋白质组缺乏功能注释，阻碍了药物发现。

Method: 使用DEtection TRansformer评估酶功能概率，在4,476个标记的寄生虫蛋白上微调分层最近邻EC预测器，应用拒绝采样保留100%置信度的四级EC分类。

Result: 为14,772个先前未表征的蛋白分配了精确EC编号，发现了543个W. bancrofti中先前未知的EC类别。筛选出6个酶靶点，预测结合亲和力低于1微摩尔。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提供了W. bancrofti暗蛋白质组的大规模功能图谱，加速了该物种的早期药物开发。

Abstract: Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic
filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million
at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack
of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark
proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present
a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino
acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and
drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the
probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor
EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling
to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This
pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized
proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A
qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical
tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized
six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall
inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune
interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound
library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein
conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong
predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs
against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing
promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental
validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale
functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage
drug development for the species.

### [2] [Mitigating Surgical Data Imbalance with Dual-Prediction Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07345)
*Danush Kumar Venkatesh,Adam Schmidt,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal,Omid Mohareri*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: SurgiFlowVid是一个稀疏可控的视频扩散框架，用于生成手术视频中代表性不足类别的合成数据，通过联合去噪RGB帧和光流来改善运动建模，缓解数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频数据集通常存在严重不平衡问题，罕见动作和工具代表性不足，这限制了下游模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出双预测扩散模块，联合去噪RGB帧和光流；使用稀疏视觉编码器，基于轻量信号（如稀疏分割掩码或RGB帧）控制生成过程。

Result: 在三个手术数据集上的验证显示，该方法生成的数据在动作识别、工具存在检测和腹腔镜运动预测等任务中，相比基线方法获得10-20%的稳定提升。

Conclusion: SurgiFlowVid是缓解数据不平衡、推进手术视频理解方法的有前景策略。

Abstract: Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling
procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are
often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which
limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with
$SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for
generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach
introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames
and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion
modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions
the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks
or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate
our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action
recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction.
Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over
competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to
mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.

### [3] [Learning from Limited Multi-Phase CT: Dual-Branch Prototype-Guided Framework for Early Recurrence Prediction in HCC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07347)
*Hsin-Pei Yu,Si-Qin Lyu,Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Weichung Wang,Tung-Hung Su,Jia-Horng Kao,Che Lin*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出DuoProto双分支原型引导框架，通过有限的多期相数据增强单期相CT的早期复发预测能力，解决临床实践中多期相数据不完整的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝细胞癌根治性切除术后早期复发预测是临床管理的关键挑战。虽然临床指南推荐使用完整多期相增强CT，但在实际应用中，单期相门静脉期扫描常被单独使用，导致模型假设与实际部署条件不匹配。

Method: 采用双分支架构：主分支处理单期相图像，辅助分支利用可用的多期相扫描，通过跨域原型对齐指导表示学习。使用结构化原型表示作为类别锚点，并结合基于排名的监督机制纳入临床相关复发风险因素。

Result: 广泛实验表明DuoProto优于现有方法，特别是在类别不平衡和缺失期相条件下。消融研究进一步验证了双分支、原型引导设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架符合当前临床应用需求，为肝细胞癌复发风险预测提供了通用解决方案，支持更明智的临床决策。

Abstract: Early recurrence (ER) prediction after curative-intent resection remains a
critical challenge in the clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full
multi-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely
performed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently
available across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV)
scans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging
resources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such
as contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a
mismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of
real-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively
leverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a
Dual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction
from single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training.
DuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes
single-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase
scans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment.
Structured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature
discrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates
clinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance
and missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design. Our framework aligns
with current clinical application needs and provides a general solution for
recurrence risk prediction in HCC, supporting more informed decision-making.

### [4] [Quantification of protein homodimer affinity using native mass spectrometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08324)
*Jonathan Schulte,Eric Schwegler,Ute A. Hellmich,Nina Morgner*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种基于定量激光诱导液滴离子解吸质谱(qLILBID-MS)的新方法，用于准确测定蛋白质同源二聚体的解离常数(KD)，克服了传统质谱在分析同源寡聚体时的信号重叠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物过程依赖于生物大分子间的精确相互作用，解离常数(KD)的测定在基础研究和药物开发中至关重要。传统方法在分析同源寡聚体时存在信号重叠问题，需要开发新的定量分析方法。

Method: 通过样品稀释和共价交联分别分析每个寡聚物种的电荷状态分布，从而解析单体/二聚体对重叠质谱峰的贡献，使用qLILBID-MS技术进行定量分析。

Result: qLILBID-MS能够准确捕获牛血清白蛋白和锥虫氧化还原酶Tryparedoxin的同源二聚体亲和力，成功监测了通过突变关键二聚体界面接触点导致的同源二聚体亲和力逐渐降低。该方法仅需其他方法(如等温滴定量热法)的少量样品，可获得高微摩尔范围内的蛋白质同源二聚体KD值。

Conclusion: qLILBID-MS是一种灵敏、稳健、快速、可扩展且经济高效的蛋白质/蛋白质相互作用定量方法，可加速当代药物发现工作流程，如高效筛选接近诱导分子(如蛋白水解靶向嵌合体和分子胶)。

Abstract: Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions
between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by
the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must
be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal
method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large
range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require
labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity
of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but
typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass
signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to
overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of
each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.
Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead
Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the
affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of
Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei
parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently,
qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as
isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein
homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the
gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface
contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and
cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can
accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening
for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and
molecular glues.

### [5] [Upconverting microgauges reveal intraluminal force dynamics in vivo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07657)
*Jason R. Casar,Claire A. McLellan,Cindy Shi,Ariel Stiber,Alice Lay,Chris Siefe,Abhinav Parakh,Malaya Gaerlan,X. Wendy Gu,Miriam B. Goodman,Jennifer A. Dionne*

Main category: q-bio.TO

TL;DR: 开发了无毒可摄入的机械传感器（微测力计），用于定量研究腔道结构中的力，并在活体秀丽隐杆线虫中测量了摄食时的咬合力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然存在非侵入性电生理技术，但大多数机械传感器无法非侵入性地访问腔道结构，因此需要开发能够定量研究腔道力的新方法。

Method: 使用NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4上转换纳米颗粒嵌入聚苯乙烯微球中制成光学微测力计，结合光学显微镜和原子力显微镜进行体外研究，通过荧光成像和非侵入性电生理学在活体线虫中应用。

Result: 力引起发射红光与绿光比值的线性无滞后变化；成年线虫在摄食时产生约10微牛顿的咬合力，力产生的时间模式与摄食器官的肌肉活动一致；测量的咬合力对应于能够裂解细菌食物的赫兹接触应力。

Conclusion: 微测力计有潜力在衰老、基因突变和药物治疗等条件下，对该器官和其他腔道器官的神经肌肉应力进行定量研究。

Abstract: The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food
and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although
non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist, most mechanosensors cannot
access luminal structures non-invasively. Here we introduce non-toxic
ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces
and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms.
These optical 'microgauges' comprise NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 upconverting
nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical
microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show
that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted
red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive
electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during
feeding on the order of 10 micronewtons and that the temporal pattern of force
generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the
bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure
range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm. Microgauges have the
potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular
stresses are affected by aging, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this
organ and other luminal organs.

### [6] [Large-scale spatial variable gene atlas for spatial transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07653)
*Jiawen Chen,Jinwei Zhang,Dongshen Peng,Yutong Song,Aitong Ruan,Yun Li,Didong Li*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 对20种空间可变基因检测方法进行大规模基准测试，构建首个跨组织SVG图谱，揭示不同组织间空间基因程序的相似性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着空间转录组学技术的发展，准确识别不同平台、组织类型和疾病背景下的空间可变基因成为重要机遇和计算挑战

Method: 使用STimage-1K4M资源中的662张人类组织切片，评估20种SVG检测方法在生物学和技术标准上的表现

Result: 发现性能差异显著依赖于组织类型、空间分辨率和研究设计，构建了跨组织SVG图谱，揭示了与发育和功能相关的组织间相似性

Conclusion: 为评估和解释空间基因表达建立了框架，为空间转录组学界提供了参考资源

Abstract: Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue
architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial
transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs
across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a
major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a
comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods
using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data
comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method
across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including
recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide
reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to
technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance
depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond
benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling
comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues.
We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and
functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node,
and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune
infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work
defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and
establishes a reference resource for the ST community.

### [7] [Evaluating multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation fitted to heterogeneous datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08151)
*André Luís Luza,Didier Alard,Frédéric Barraquand*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 该研究评估了包含时空自相关效应的多季节占据模型在高度异质性蝴蝶占据数据集中的表现，发现模型对数据异质性和协变量重叠具有鲁棒性，但在存在严重时空数据缺口时会出现可识别性问题，导致占据率预测偏向平均值且被高估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然考虑不完全检测的占据模型在生态学中已广泛应用，且最近提出通过建模时空自相关来解决占据数据中因缺乏重复观测而导致的可识别性问题，但这些模型在高度异质性数据集（特别是缺失数据或单次访问数据占主导的情况）中的表现仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 基于异质性细尺度蝴蝶占据数据集，评估了包含时空随机效应的多季节占据模型对以下因素的鲁棒性：每个地点调查次数的偏态分布、占据和检测子模型之间的协变量重叠、以及观测的时空聚类。

Result: 结果显示模型对异质性数据和协变量重叠具有鲁棒性。但当添加时空缺口时，地点占据率偏向平均占据率，且平均占据率本身被高估。随机效应未能纠正缺口的影响，原因是方差和自相关参数的可识别性问题。对两种蝴蝶物种的占据分析进一步证实了这些结果。

Conclusion: 总体上，具有自相关效应的多季节占据模型对异质性数据和协变量重叠具有鲁棒性，但仍存在可识别性问题，并且在面临严重数据缺口时受到挑战，这会损害即使在数据丰富区域的预测能力。

Abstract: Predicting species distributions using occupancy models accounting for
imperfect detection is now commonplace in ecology. Recently, modelling spatial
and temporal autocorrelation was proposed to alleviate the lack of replication
in occupancy data, which often prevents model identifiability. However, how
such models perform in highly heterogeneous datasets where missing or
single-visit data dominates remains an open question. Motivated by an
heterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the
performance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random
effects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site,
overlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and
spatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is
robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when
spatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average
occupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence
of gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation
parameters. Occupancy analysis of two butterfly species further confirmed these
results. Overall, multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation are robust
to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap, but still present identifiability
issues and are challenged by severe data gaps, which compromise predictions
even in data-rich areas.

### [8] [PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07964)
*Jiabei Cheng,Changxi Chi,Jingbo Zhou,Hongyi Xin,Jun Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PRESCRIBE框架，用于单细胞扰动预测中联合估计模型不确定性和数据不确定性，通过置信评分提高预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测需要评估预测可靠性，因为基因扰动是随机过程，需要考虑训练数据中未见基因的相似性（模型不确定性）和训练数据质量（数据不确定性）。

Method: 开发了PRESCRIBE，一个多变量深度证据回归框架，能够同时测量两种不确定性来源。

Result: PRESCRIBE能有效估计每个预测的置信分数，与经验准确率强相关，相比基线方法实现了超过3%的稳定准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够过滤不可靠的预测结果，为单细胞扰动预测提供了可靠的置信度评估方法。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

*Jianzhe Wei,Jingwen Zhu,Pan Chu,Liang Luo,Xiongfei Fu*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 首次在合成细菌基因电路中单细胞水平观测到状态转变，发现转变过程不符合经典Kramers理论的小噪声假设，缺乏单一特征速率，存在显著乘性噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物系统中的状态转变是基础过程但难以直接观测，需要开发新的实验方法来研究这些转变的动力学特性。

Method: 使用mother machine设备追踪1007个细胞超过27小时，采用首通分析和动力学重建方法。

Result: 观测到状态转变发生在小噪声区域之外，缺乏单一特征转变速率，存在显著乘性噪声会扭曲有效势能景观但增加转变时间。

Conclusion: 需要超越小噪声假设的理论框架来理解生物状态转变过程。

Abstract: State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to
observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state
transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine,
we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical
reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime,
challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a
single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between
discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts
the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These
findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions
beyond the small-noise assumption.
