As spatial\ntranscriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs\nacross diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a\nmajor opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a\ncomprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods\nusing human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data\ncomprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method\nacross a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including\nrecovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide\nreproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to\ntechnical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance\ndepending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond\nbenchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling\ncomparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues.\nWe observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and\nfunctional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node,\nand uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune\ninfiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work\ndefines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and\nestablishes a reference resource for the ST community."}

Our approach\nintroduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames\nand optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion\nmodeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions\nthe generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks\nor RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations.

Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full\nmulti-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely\nperformed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently\navailable across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV)\nscans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging\nresources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such\nas contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a\nmismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of\nreal-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively\nleverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a\nDual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction\nfrom single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training.\nDuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes\nsingle-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase\nscans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment.\nStructured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature\ndiscrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates\nclinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance\nand missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the\neffectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design. Our framework aligns\nwith current clinical application needs and provides a general solution for\nrecurrence risk prediction in HCC, supporting more informed decision-making."}

The strength of an interaction, typically given by\nthe dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must\nbe monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal\nmethod for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large\nrange of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require\nlabeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity\nof the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but\ntypically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass\nsignals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to\noverlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of\neach oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.\nFollowing this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead\nIon Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the\naffinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of\nTryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei\nparasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently,\nqLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as\nisothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein\nhomodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the\ngradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface\ncontacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and\ncost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can\naccelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening\nfor proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and\nmolecular glues."}

Motivated by an\nheterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the\nperformance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random\neffects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site,\noverlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and\nspatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is\nrobust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when\nspatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average\noccupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence\nof gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation\nparameters.
