*Huifa Li,Feilong Tang,Haochen Xue,Yulong Li,Xinlin Zhuang,Bin Zhang,Eran Segal,Imran Razzak*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于多组学数据的衰老时钟，利用机器学习框架预测健康结果和疾病风险，并发现了不同的衰老生物亚型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于衰老过程复杂且个体差异大，生物年龄比实际年龄更能反映生理衰退。现有基于单组学数据的衰老时钟无法捕捉人类衰老的完整分子复杂性。

Method: 利用Human Phenotype Project队列的12,000名30-70岁成年人数据，整合临床、行为、环境和多组学数据，采用先进机器学习框架建模非线性生物动态。

Result: 开发了稳健的多组学衰老时钟，能预测多种健康结果和未来疾病风险；通过无监督聚类发现了不同的衰老生物亚型，揭示了衰老轨迹的异质性和通路特异性改变。

Conclusion: 多组学整合能解码衰老的分子景观，为个性化健康监测和预防年龄相关疾病的精准策略奠定基础。

Abstract: Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at
different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate
indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous
studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to
capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we
leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults
aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes
clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning
transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing
advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological
dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that
robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised
clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered
distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in
aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with
different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics
integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork
for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent
age-related diseases.

### [2] [Same model, better performance: the impact of shuffling on DNA Language Models benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12617)
*Davide Greco,Konrad Rawlik*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 本文提出了BEND基准测试框架，揭示了硬件相关超参数（如数据加载工作线程数和缓冲区大小）会导致DNA语言模型性能出现高达4%的虚假变化，并提出了预混洗数据的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNA语言模型在基因组学中日益流行，需要一个标准化基准来评估其能力。但评估过程复杂，涉及基因组学领域特定挑战和机器学习方法，其中微小的实现细节可能严重影响基准有效性。

Method: 通过BEND基准测试框架，研究硬件相关超参数对DNA语言模型性能的影响，测试了三种模型（HyenaDNA、DNABERT-2、ResNet-LM），并提出了数据预混洗的解决方案。

Result: 实验显示硬件依赖超参数导致相同模型出现高达4%的性能变化，这些伪影影响绝对性能和相对模型排名。预混洗数据可消除硬件依赖性同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 标准机器学习实践可能与领域特定数据特征产生意外交互，这对专业领域的基准设计具有更广泛的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly popular in genomics due to their
potential to decode complex biological sequences. Hence, researchers require a
standardized benchmark to evaluate DNA Language Models (DNA LMs) capabilities.
However, evaluating DNA LMs is a complex task that intersects genomic's
domain-specific challenges and machine learning methodologies, where seemingly
minor implementation details can significantly compromise benchmark validity.
We demonstrate this through BEND (Benchmarking DNA Language Models), where
hardware-dependent hyperparameters -- number of data loading workers and buffer
sizes -- create spurious performance variations of up to 4% for identical
models. The problem stems from inadequate data shuffling interacting with
domain specific data characteristics. Experiments with three DNA language
models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2, ResNet-LM) show these artifacts affect both
absolute performance and relative model rankings. We propose a simple solution:
pre-shuffling data before storage eliminates hardware dependencies while
maintaining efficiency. This work highlights how standard ML practices can
interact unexpectedly with domain-specific data characteristics, with broader
implications for benchmark design in specialized domains.

### [3] [scPPDM: A Diffusion Model for Single-Cell Drug-Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11726)
*Zhaokang Liang,Shuyang Zhuang,Xiaoran Jiao,Weian Mao,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: scPPDM是首个基于扩散模型的单细胞药物反应预测框架，通过耦合预处理状态和药物剂量条件，在Tahoe-100M基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单细胞RNA测序数据中药物反应预测的挑战，提供可解释的控制接口来减少实验负担并保持生物特异性。

Method: 使用非连接式GD-Attn在统一潜在空间中耦合两个条件通道（预处理状态和药物剂量），采用因子化无分类器引导实现状态保持和药物反应强度的可解释控制。

Result: 在Tahoe-100M基准测试的未见协变量组合和未见药物两种严格机制下，scPPDM在log fold-change恢复、delta相关性、解释方差和DE重叠等指标上均达到最先进水平，相比第二佳模型在UD机制下DEG logFC-Spearman/Pearson分别提升36.11%/34.21%。

Conclusion: scPPDM提供了一个透明的what-if分析和剂量调优控制界面，能够显著减少实验负担同时保持生物特异性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction Diffusion Model
(scPPDM), the first diffusion-based framework for single-cell drug-response
prediction from scRNA-seq data. scPPDM couples two condition channels,
pre-perturbation state and drug with dose, in a unified latent space via
non-concatenative GD-Attn. During inference, factorized classifier-free
guidance exposes two interpretable controls for state preservation and
drug-response strength and maps dose to guidance magnitude for tunable
intensity. Evaluated on the Tahoe-100M benchmark under two stringent regimes,
unseen covariate combinations (UC) and unseen drugs (UD), scPPDM sets new
state-of-the-art results across log fold-change recovery, delta correlations,
explained variance, and DE-overlap. Representative gains include
+36.11%/+34.21% on DEG logFC-Spearman/Pearson in UD over the second-best model.
This control interface enables transparent what-if analyses and dose tuning,
reducing experimental burden while preserving biological specificity.

### [4] [Mixture of Inverse Gaussians for Hemodynamic Transport (MIGHT) in Vascular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11743)
*Timo Jakumeit,Bastian Heinlein,Leonie Richter,Sebastian Lotter,Robert Schober,Maximilian Schäfer*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MIGHT的闭式物理模型，用于描述信号分子在复杂血管网络中的对流扩散传输，该模型将接收到的分子通量表示为逆高斯分布的加权和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论模型分析复杂性有限且缺乏闭式解，使得大规模血管网络的分析不可行或不具洞察力，需要开发更实用的模型来支持心血管系统中的合成分子通信应用。

Method: 提出MIGHT模型，将接收分子通量表示为逆高斯分布的加权和，参数化网络的物理特性，并通过与现有卷积模型和有限元模拟进行比较来验证模型。

Result: 模型验证显示与现有方法和模拟结果一致，并能应用于大型血管网络的简化表示和基于接收信号估计未知血管网络。

Conclusion: MIGHT模型为心血管系统中分子通信系统的设计提供了实用的闭式物理模型，支持网络简化和逆向网络估计等应用。

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (MC) in the cardiovascular system (CVS) is
a key enabler for many envisioned medical applications in the human body, such
as targeted drug delivery, early cancer detection, and continuous health
monitoring. The design of MC systems for such applications requires suitable
models for the signaling molecule propagation through complex vessel networks
(VNs). Existing theoretical models offer limited analytical tractability and
lack closed-form solutions, making the analysis of large-scale VNs either
infeasible or not insightful. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we
propose a novel closed-form physical model, termed MIGHT, for
advection-diffusion-driven transport of signaling molecules through complex
VNs. The model represents the received molecule flux as a weighted sum of
inverse Gaussian (IG) distributions, parameterized by physical properties of
the network. The proposed model is validated by comparison with an existing
convolution-based model and finite-element simulations. Further, we show that
the model can be applied for the reduction of large VNs to simplified
representations preserving the essential transport dynamics and for estimating
representative VN based on received signals from unknown VNs.

### [5] [PRISM: Enhancing Protein Inverse Folding through Fine-Grained Retrieval on Structure-Sequence Multimodal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11750)
*Sazan Mahbub,Souvik Kundu,Eric P. Xing*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: PRISM是一个多模态检索增强生成框架，通过检索已知蛋白质中的细粒度结构-序列模式来解决蛋白质逆折叠问题，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在蛋白质逆折叠中缺乏显式机制来重用自然蛋白质中保守的细粒度结构-序列模式，限制了性能提升。

Method: PRISM采用多模态检索增强生成框架，从已知蛋白质中检索细粒度潜在基序表示，并结合混合自交叉注意力解码器进行序列设计，以潜变量概率模型形式实现。

Result: 在CATH-4.2、TS50、TS500、CAMEO 2022和PDB日期分割五个基准测试中，PRISM在困惑度和氨基酸恢复率方面均达到最新技术水平，同时提高了可折叠性指标（RMSD、TM-score、pLDDT）。

Conclusion: 细粒度多模态检索是蛋白质序列设计的一个强大而高效的范式，能够显著提升逆折叠任务的性能。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target three-dimensional
structure, known as the inverse folding problem, is central to protein
engineering but remains challenging due to the vast sequence space and the
importance of local structural constraints. Existing deep learning approaches
achieve strong recovery rates, yet they lack explicit mechanisms to reuse
fine-grained structure-sequence patterns that are conserved across natural
proteins. We present PRISM, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation
framework for inverse folding that retrieves fine-grained representations of
potential motifs from known proteins and integrates them with a hybrid
self-cross attention decoder. PRISM is formulated as a latent-variable
probabilistic model and implemented with an efficient approximation, combining
theoretical grounding with practical scalability. Across five benchmarks
(CATH-4.2, TS50, TS500, CAMEO 2022, and the PDB date split), PRISM establishes
new state of the art in both perplexity and amino acid recovery, while also
improving foldability metrics (RMSD, TM-score, pLDDT), demonstrating that
fine-grained multimodal retrieval is a powerful and efficient paradigm for
protein sequence design.

### [6] [Fast and Interpretable Protein Substructure Alignment via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11752)
*Zhiyu Wang,Bingxin Zhou,Jing Wang,Yang Tan,Weishu Zhao,Pietro Liò,Liang Hong*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: PLASMA是首个用于高效可解释残基级蛋白质亚结构对齐的深度学习框架，通过正则化最优传输和可微分Sinkhorn迭代实现准确、轻量且可解释的蛋白质局部结构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质局部基序（如活性位点）对理解蛋白质功能和进化至关重要，但现有计算方法难以有效识别和比较这些局部结构，限制了蛋白质结构分析和功能利用。

Method: 将问题重新表述为正则化最优传输任务，利用可微分Sinkhorn迭代，PLASMA能够输出清晰的比对矩阵和可解释的总体相似性分数。

Result: 通过广泛的定量评估和三个生物学案例研究，证明PLASMA实现了准确、轻量且可解释的残基级比对，并开发了无需训练数据的PLASMA-PF变体。

Conclusion: PLASMA填补了蛋白质结构分析工具的关键空白，为功能注释、进化研究和基于结构的药物设计提供了新机会。

Abstract: Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that execute life functions.
Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most
critical components for linking structure to function and are key to
understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing
computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures,
which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and
harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning
framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure
alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task
and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein
structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable
overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three
biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate,
lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we
introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical
alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical
gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for
functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design.
Reproducibility is ensured via our official implementation at

### [7] [Optimal Pair Matching Combined with Machine Learning Predicts a Significant Reduction in Myocardial Infarction Risk in African Americans following Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11756)
*Shudong Sun,Aki Hara,Laurel Johnstone,Brian Hallmark,Joseph C. Watkins,Cynthia A. Thomson,Susan M. Schembre,Susan Sergeant,Jason Umans,Guang Yao,Hao Helen Zhang,Floyd H. Chilton*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本研究通过倾向评分匹配分析VITAL试验数据，发现在非洲裔美国人中，omega-3高度不饱和脂肪酸补充显著降低心肌梗死风险，但在非西班牙裔白人中无此效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VITAL试验显示omega-3补充对心血管无整体益处，但其大量非洲裔美国人参与为探索种族差异提供了独特机会。

Method: 使用倾向评分匹配3,766名非洲裔美国人和15,553名非西班牙裔白人，通过加权决策树和LASSO逻辑回归分析补充剂对心肌梗死、中风和心血管疾病死亡率的影响。

Result: 在非洲裔美国人中，omega-3补充显著降低心肌梗死风险（OR 0.17, 95% CI [0.048, 0.60]），但在非西班牙裔白人中无此效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要未来随机对照试验探索omega-3补充在种族间的差异，并指出非洲裔美国人与非西班牙裔白人之间可能存在因果差异。

Abstract: Conflicting clinical trial results on omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids
(n-3 HUFA) have prompted uncertainty about their cardioprotective effects.
While the VITAL trial found no overall cardiovascular benefit from n-3 HUFA
supplementation, its substantial African American (AfAm) enrollment provided a
unique opportunity to explore racial differences in response to n-3 HUFA
supplementation. The current observational study aimed to simulate randomized
clinical trial (RCT) conditions by matching 3,766 AfAm and 15,553 non-Hispanic
White (NHW) individuals from the VITAL trial utilizing propensity score
matching to address the limitations related to differences in confounding
variables between the two groups. Within matched groups (3,766 AfAm and 3,766
NHW), n-3 HUFA supplementation's impact on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke,
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was assessed. A weighted decision
tree analysis revealed belonging to the n-3 supplementation group as the most
significant predictor of MI among AfAm but not NHW. Further logistic regression
using the LASSO method and bootstrap estimation of standard errors indicated
n-3 supplementation significantly lowered MI risk in AfAm (OR 0.17, 95% CI
[0.048, 0.60]), with no such effect in NHW. This study underscores the critical
need for future RCT to explore racial disparities in MI risk associated with
n-3 HUFA supplementation and highlights potential causal differences between
supplementation health outcomes in AfAm versus NHW populations.

*Allison Powell,Paramahansa Pramanik*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: MYB基因过表达与前列腺癌不良预后相关，特别是在黑人男性中MYB水平显著升高，可能解释种族间临床结果差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中侵袭性变种致死率高，MYB原癌基因在促进肿瘤进展、治疗抵抗和疾病复发中起关键作用，且在不同种族间表达差异可能解释临床结果差异。

Method: 采用多模式方法，整合组织病理学检查、定量数字成像和公共转录组数据集分析。

Result: MYB过表达与不良预后密切相关，包括雄激素受体信号、疾病进展和生化复发风险。

Conclusion: MYB有潜力作为预后生物标志物和个体化治疗策略的开发候选靶点。

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a significant global health concern among men,
particularly due to the lethality of its more aggressive variants. Despite
therapeutic advancements that have enhanced survival for many patients, high
grade PCa continues to contribute substantially to cancer related mortality.
Emerging evidence points to the MYB proto-oncogene as a critical factor in
promoting tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and disease relapse.
Notably, differential expression patterns have been observed, with markedly
elevated MYB levels in tumor tissues from Black men relative to their White
counterparts potentially offering insight into documented racial disparities in
clinical outcomes. This study investigates the association between MYB
expression and key oncogenic features, including androgen receptor (AR)
signaling, disease progression, and the risk of biochemical recurrence.
Employing a multimodal approach that integrates histopathological examination,
quantitative digital imaging, and analyses of public transcriptomic datasets,
our findings suggest that MYB overexpression is strongly linked to adverse
prognosis. These results underscore MYB's potential as a prognostic biomarker
and as a candidate for the development of individualized therapeutic
strategies.

### [9] [TopROI: A topology-informed network approach for tissue partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12772)
*Sergio Serrano de Haro Iváñez,Joshua W. Moore,Lucile Grzesiak,Eoghan J. Mullholand,Heather Harrington,Simon J. Leedham,Helen M. Byrne*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: TopROI是一种基于拓扑和网络的方法，用于将点云数据划分为保留局部几何和高阶结构的感兴趣区域，优于传统的四象限方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统四象限方法在定义感兴趣区域时忽略内在结构，可能破坏有意义的特征，需要一种能保持组织架构的方法。

Method: TopROI结合几何信息网络和持久同调，利用细胞邻域和多尺度循环来指导社区检测，生成生物学上有意义的感兴趣区域。

Result: 在合成点云和人类结直肠癌活检数据中，TopROI能保持隐窝样结构，揭示从健康黏膜到癌变组织的连续结构变化。

Conclusion: TopROI提供了一个原则性和灵活的框架，用于在大型点云中定义生物学上有意义的感兴趣区域，更准确地量化组织结构和疾病进展相关的变化。

Abstract: Mammalian tissue architecture is central to biological function, and its
disruption is a hallmark of disease. Medical imaging techniques can generate
large point cloud datasets that capture changes in the cellular composition of
such tissues with disease progression. However, regions of interest (ROIs) are
usually defined by quadrat-based methods that ignore intrinsic structure and
risk fragmenting meaningful features. Here, we introduce TopROI, a
topology-informed, network-based method for partitioning point clouds into ROIs
that preserves both local geometry and higher-order architecture. TopROI
integrates geometry-informed networks with persistent homology, combining cell
neighbourhoods and multiscale cycles to guide community detection. Applied to
synthetic point clouds that mimic glandular structure, TopROI outperforms
quadrat-based and purely geometric partitions by maintaining biologically
plausible ROI geometry and better preserving ground-truth structures. Applied
to cellular point clouds obtained from human colorectal cancer biopsies, TopROI
generates ROIs that preserve crypt-like structures and enable persistent
homology analysis of individual regions. This study reveals a continuum of
architectural changes from healthy mucosa to carcinoma, reflecting progressive
disorganisation in tissue structure. TopROI thus provides a principled and
flexible framework for defining biologically meaningful ROIs in large point
clouds, enabling more accurate quantification of tissue organization and new
insights into structural changes associated with disease progression.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: qSimCells是一种新型混合量子-经典模拟器，利用量子纠缠建模单细胞转录组，能够捕捉基因调控网络和细胞间通信的非线性依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统scRNA-seq数据模拟方法依赖线性相关性，无法捕捉内在的非线性依赖关系以及同时发生的基因-基因和细胞-细胞相互作用。

Method: 使用参数化量子电路和CNOT门构建量子核，编码复杂的非线性基因调控网络和细胞间通信拓扑结构，具有明确的方向性（因果性）。

Result: 合成数据展现出非经典依赖关系，经典相关性方法无法重建完整的量子因果路径。CellChat2.0验证显示，当量子纠缠激活时，通信概率相对增加高达75倍。

Conclusion: 量子核对于创建高保真真实数据至关重要，需要先进推理技术来捕捉基因调控中固有的复杂非经典依赖关系。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by
classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the
intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies and the simultaneous gene-gene and cell-cell
interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel hybrid quantum-classical
simulator that leverages quantum entanglement to model single-cell
transcriptomes. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a
parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene
regulatory network (GRN) and cell-cell communication topologies with explicit
directionality (causality). The synthetic data exhibits non-classical
dependencies that challenge standard analysis. We demonstrated that classical
correlation methods (Pearson and Spearman) failed to reconstruct the complete
programmed quantum causal paths, instead reporting spurious statistical
artifacts driven by high base-gene expression probabilities. Applying
CellChat2.0 to the simulated cell-cell communication validated the true
mechanistic links by showing a robust, relative increase in communication
probability (up to 75-fold) only when the quantum entanglement was active. This
work confirms that the quantum kernel is essential for creating high-fidelity
ground truth data, highlighting the need for advanced inference techniques to
capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.

### [11] [ECMSim: A high-performance web simulation of cardiac ECM remodeling through integrated ODE-based signaling and diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12577)
*Hasi Hays,William Richardson*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: ECMSim是一个实时交互式网络应用，用于模拟异质性细胞外基质重塑，特别针对心脏疤痕组织，通过大规模心脏成纤维细胞信号网络模型进行仿真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞外基质重塑在多种健康和组织疾病过程中至关重要，但由于其受复杂细胞内和细胞外分子反应网络调控，预测不同化学和机械条件下的ECM重塑极具挑战性。

Method: 使用大规模心脏成纤维细胞信号网络模型，在100*100空间阵列（10,000个细胞）中实时模拟超过130万个方程，包括125种以上物种和200多条边，结合常微分方程和ECM分子扩散。

Result: 开发了一个功能完整的网络应用，支持实时模拟、可视化交互和模型编辑，能够研究病理或实验条件、假设场景、基质重塑或实验药物效果。

Conclusion: ECMSim通过标准网络技术实现，为研究ECM重塑提供了强大的实时仿真平台，能够有效探索各种生物医学场景。

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy
and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under
various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively
challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and
extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally
dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web
application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current
model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a
large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis
is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3
million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125
species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000
cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades,
ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The
algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on
demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes
brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input
molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and
multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple
scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully
functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction,
and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or
experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the
testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.

### [12] [Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763)
*Saurabh Sihag,Gonzalo Mateos,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了基于图信号处理的脑年龄差距预测框架，使用协方差神经网络从结构MRI中估计脑年龄差距，作为脑健康的生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经退行性病变评估方法缺乏统计复杂性，无法充分捕捉神经退化的空间相关性和异质性。脑年龄差距作为数据驱动的脑健康生物标志物具有潜力，但现有方法存在方法学不透明和泛化性差的问题。

Method: 提出基于图信号处理的框架，使用图神经网络特别是协方差神经网络，利用结构MRI导出的解剖协方差矩阵来估计脑年龄差距。

Result: VNNs提供了强大的理论基础和操作可解释性，能够实现稳健的脑年龄差距预测估计。

Conclusion: 通过整合图信号处理、机器学习和网络神经科学的视角，为可靠且可解释的BAGP模型指明了前进方向，并概述了精准医学的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal
structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through
reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural
MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical
sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and
heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy
aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age
gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain
age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's
predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The
resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with
recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and
severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their
methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical
populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces
a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in
graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks
(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the
anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong
theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust
estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP,
machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path
forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research
directions in personalized medicine.

Conclusion: 多任务微调化学预训练图神经网络模型能有效提升药物属性预测性能，特别是在大数据场景下。作者提供了加速的KERMT实现，支持工业级药物发现工作流。

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.
