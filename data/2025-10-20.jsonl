This\nresearch develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical\nventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from\nobservations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an\nunderstanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires\nthe analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses\nabout advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work\nintroduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems\n(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories\nof these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using\nevolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative\nprecursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery\nsuch as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway\ntoward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is\nanalytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before\nproceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the\ndata-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments\ntoward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using\nempirical and game-theoretic elements."}
