*Jahidul Arafat,Sanjaya Poudel,Fariha Tasmin,Md Kaosar Uddin,Eftakhar Ahmed Arnob*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: RawHash3是一个结合图神经网络和动态规划的混合框架，用于纳米孔测序的自适应种子链化，在保持实时性能的同时提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳米孔测序虽然能实现实时长读长DNA测序，但12-15%的固有错误率给读段比对带来了计算挑战。现有方法使用固定的间隙惩罚函数，无法适应串联重复和结构变异等不同基因组环境。

Method: 将种子链化形式化为图学习问题，种子构成具有12维特征向量的节点，边编码8维空间关系。采用三层EdgeConv图神经网络架构，结合基于置信度的方法选择，动态切换学习指导和算法回退。

Result: 在1,000个合成纳米孔读段和5,200个测试种子的综合评估中，RawHash3达到99.94%的精确率和40.07%的召回率，相比基线有25.0%的相对改进（p<0.001）。中位推理延迟为1.59ms，在20%标签损坏下保持100%成功率，而基线降至30.3%。

Conclusion: 交叉验证确认了稳定性，确立了图神经网络作为生产基因组学管道的可行方法。

Abstract: Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads
exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present
significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed
chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference
genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on
fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts
including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3,
a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic
programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance
while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph
learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and
edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our
architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method
selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic
fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200
test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07
percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative
improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median
inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating
superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label
corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation
confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for
production genomics pipelines.

### [2] [Identifying multi-omics interactions for lung cancer drug targets discovery using Kernel Machine Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16093)
*Md. Imtyaz Ahmed,Md. Delwar Hossain,Md Mostafizer Rahman,Md. Ahsan Habib,Md. Mamunur Rashid,Md. Selim Reza,Md Ashad Alam*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 该论文通过整合多组学数据（基因表达、DNA甲基化、miRNA表达）分析肺癌，使用四种统计方法和核机器回归方法识别出38个与肺癌显著相关的基因，并发现三种潜在候选药物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症表现出由多方面分子相互作用驱动的多样化和复杂表型。整合多组学数据集提供了识别癌症相关遗传变异和深入理解疾病发展的有效方法，但理解多组学数据特征间的复杂相互作用比单组学更具挑战性。

Method: 使用LIMMA、T检验、典型相关分析和Wilcoxon检验四种统计方法分析TCGA的肺癌多组学数据，识别差异表达基因，然后使用核机器回归方法整合多组学数据。

Result: 发现基因表达、miRNA表达和DNA甲基化三个组学在肺癌中存在显著相互作用，识别出38个与肺癌显著相关的基因，其中8个排名最高的基因（PDGFRB、PDGFRA、SNAI1、ID1、FGF11、TNXB、ITGB1、ZIC1）通过严格统计分析突出显示。

Conclusion: 通过计算机模拟研究确定了三种排名最高的潜在候选药物（Selinexor、Orapred和Capmatinib），这些药物可能在肺癌治疗中发挥关键作用，且得到其他独立研究结果的支持。

Abstract: Cancer exhibits diverse and complex phenotypes driven by multifaceted
molecular interactions. Recent biomedical research has emphasized the
comprehensive study of such diseases by integrating multi-omics datasets
(genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome). This approach provides an
efficient method for identifying genetic variants associated with cancer and
offers a deeper understanding of how the disease develops and spreads. However,
it is challenging to comprehend complex interactions among the features of
multi-omics datasets compared to single omics. In this paper, we analyze lung
cancer multi-omics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using four
statistical methods, LIMMA, the T test, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA),
and the Wilcoxon test, we identified differentially expressed genes across gene
expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. We then integrated
these multi-omics data using the Kernel Machine Regression (KMR) approach. Our
findings reveal significant interactions among the three omics: gene
expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation in lung cancer. From our data
analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer.
From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with
lung cancer. Among these, eight genes of highest ranking (PDGFRB, PDGFRA,
SNAI1, ID1, FGF11, TNXB, ITGB1, ZIC1) were highlighted by rigorous statistical
analysis. Furthermore, in silico studies identified three top-ranked potential
candidate drugs (Selinexor, Orapred, and Capmatinib) that could play a crucial
role in the treatment of lung cancer. These proposed drugs are also supported
by the findings of other independent studies, which underscore their potential
efficacy in the fight against lung cancer.

### [3] [Hallucinations in AlphaFold3 for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with disorder in Biological Process Residues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15939)
*Shreya Gopalan,Sundar Narayanan*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: AlphaFold3在预测内在无序蛋白(IDPs)方面存在局限性，32%的残基预测与实验数据不符，其中18%涉及生物过程的残基出现幻觉预测，可能影响药物发现和疾病研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AlphaFold3在内在无序蛋白(IDPs)预测上的表现，因为IDPs占人类蛋白质组的30-40%，在转录、信号传导和疾病中起关键作用，但AlphaFold3在这方面的性能尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用DisProt数据库中的72个蛋白质，通过多个随机种子和集成输出生成预测，比较残基级pLDDT分数与实验无序注释。

Result: 32%的残基与DisProt数据不一致，其中10%为上下文驱动的错位，18%与生物过程相关的残基出现幻觉预测。

Conclusion: AlphaFold3在建模IDRs方面存在局限性，需要改进幻觉度量标准并整合实验无序数据以提高预测可靠性。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction has advanced significantly with the introduction
of AlphaFold3, a diffusion-based model capable of predicting complex
biomolecular interactions across proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and
ions. While AlphaFold3 demonstrates high accuracy in folded proteins, its
performance on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which comprise 30 to
40 percent of the human proteome and play critical roles in transcription,
signaling, and disease, remains less explored. This study evaluated
AlphaFold3's predictions of IDPs with a focus on intrinsically disordered
regions (IDRs) using 72 proteins curated from the DisProt database. Predictions
were generated across multiple random seeds and ensemble outputs, and
residue-level pLDDT scores were compared with experimental disorder
annotations. Our analysis reveals that 32 percent of residues are misaligned
with DisProt, with percent representing hallucinations where AlphaFold3
incorrectly predicts order in disordered regions or vice versa. Additionally,
10 percent of residues exhibited context-driven misalignment, suggesting that
AlphaFold3 implicitly incorporates stable structural assumptions. Importantly,
18 percent of residues associated with biological processes showed
hallucinations, raising concerns about downstream implications in drug
discovery and disease research. These findings highlight the limitations of
AlphaFold3 in modeling IDRs, the need for refined hallucination metrics beyond
the pLDDT, and the importance of integrating experimental disorder data to
improve prediction reliability.

### [4] [TriAgent: Automated Biomarker Discovery with Deep Research Grounding for Triage in Acute Care by LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16080)
*Kerem Delikoyun,Qianyu Chen,Win Sen Kuan,John Tshon Yit Soong,Matthew Edward Cove,Oliver Hayden*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: TriAgent是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于急诊分诊中的生物标志物发现和文献验证，旨在提高风险预测的准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决急诊部门面临的日益增长的患者量、人员短缺以及分诊决策变异性问题，改进当前主要依赖生命体征、常规实验室值和临床判断的分诊方法，捕捉可能改善感染类型或抗生素使用风险预测的新兴生物信号。

Method: 采用基于LLM的多智能体框架，包括监督研究智能体生成研究主题并委托专业子智能体从各种数据源检索证据，综合发现将生物标志物分类为基于现有知识或标记为新颖候选，提供透明解释。

Result: TriAgent在主题遵循F1得分上达到55.7±5.0%，比CoT-ReAct智能体提高超过10%，忠实度得分为0.42±0.39，超过所有基线50%以上，在生物标志物论证和文献基础新颖性评估方面持续优于最先进的LLM智能体框架。

Conclusion: TriAgent提供了一个从数据分析到文献基础的端到端框架，提高了透明度和可解释性，扩展了潜在可操作临床生物标志物的前沿，为急性护理风险分层提供了新的探索途径。

Abstract: Emergency departments worldwide face rising patient volumes, workforce
shortages, and variability in triage decisions that threaten the delivery of
timely and accurate care. Current triage methods rely primarily on vital signs,
routine laboratory values, and clinicians' judgment, which, while effective,
often miss emerging biological signals that could improve risk prediction for
infection typing or antibiotic administration in acute conditions. To address
this challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based
multi-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep
research for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent
employs a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate
targeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various
data sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either
grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering
transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care
risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine
clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data
analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and
expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a
user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic
adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over
10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more
than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and
literature-grounded novelty assessment. We share our repo:

### [5] [Interpretable RNA-Seq Clustering with an LLM-Based Agentic Evidence-Grounded Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16082)
*Elias Hossain,Mehrdad Shoeibi,Ivan Garibay,Niloofar Yousefi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: CITE V.1是一个基于证据的智能框架，利用大语言模型为RNA-seq聚类提供透明可复现的解释，通过三个专门代理实现文献支持的生物学解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有富集分析方法仅提供宽泛统计关联，以及纯LLM模型可能产生无支持声明或伪造引用的问题，提升RNA-seq分析的透明度和可靠性。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：检索器从PubMed和UniProt获取领域知识，解释器制定功能假设，批评家评估声明、强制证据基础并通过置信度和可靠性指标量化不确定性。

Result: 在沙门氏菌RNA-seq数据上，CITE V.1生成了文献支持的生物学见解，而纯LLM的Gemini基线经常产生带有虚假引用的推测性结果。

Conclusion: CITE V.1将RNA-seq分析从表面富集推进到可审计、可解释和基于证据的假设生成，提升了生物医学中AI的透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: We propose CITE V.1, an agentic, evidence-grounded framework that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transparent and reproducible
interpretations of RNA-seq clusters. Unlike existing enrichment-based
approaches that reduce results to broad statistical associations and LLM-only
models that risk unsupported claims or fabricated citations, CITE V.1
transforms cluster interpretation by producing biologically coherent
explanations explicitly anchored in the biomedical literature. The framework
orchestrates three specialized agents: a Retriever that gathers domain
knowledge from PubMed and UniProt, an Interpreter that formulates functional
hypotheses, and Critics that evaluate claims, enforce evidence grounding, and
qualify uncertainty through confidence and reliability indicators. Applied to
Salmonella enterica RNA-seq data, CITE V.1 generated biologically meaningful
insights supported by the literature, while an LLM-only Gemini baseline
frequently produced speculative results with false citations. By moving RNA-seq
analysis from surface-level enrichment to auditable, interpretable, and
evidence-based hypothesis generation, CITE V.1 advances the transparency and
reliability of AI in biomedicine.

### [6] [BASIN: Bayesian mAtrix variate normal model with Spatial and sparsIty priors in Non-negative deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16130)
*Jiasen Zhang,Xi Qiao,Liangliang Zhang,Weihong Guo*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: BASIN是一种用于空间转录组学细胞类型反卷积的贝叶斯非负矩阵分解方法，通过图拉普拉斯先验和吉布斯采样提供不确定性量化，在准确性和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学提供空间分辨的基因表达数据但缺乏细胞分辨率，需要细胞类型反卷积来推断每个空间位置的细胞组成。现有方法通常寻找确定性最优解，缺乏不确定性量化。

Method: 将反卷积建模为包含图拉普拉斯先验的非负矩阵分解问题，提出矩阵变分贝叶斯NMF方法，使用非负性和稀疏性先验，通过吉布斯采样近似细胞类型比例和其他参数的后验分布。

Result: 在不同空间转录组学数据集上评估BASIN性能，在准确性和效率方面优于其他反卷积方法，结果显示了所纳入先验的效果，并反映了预期的截断矩阵正态分布。

Conclusion: BASIN通过贝叶斯框架提供细胞类型反卷积的分布解，增强了鲁棒性并提供了固有的不确定性量化，在空间转录组学分析中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to visualize and analyze gene
expression within the precise location of tissues or cells. It provides
spatially resolved gene expression data but often lacks cellular resolution,
necessitating cell type deconvolution to infer cellular composition at each
spatial location. In this paper we propose BASIN for cell type deconvolution,
which models deconvolution as a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem
incorporating graph Laplacian prior. Rather than find a deterministic optima
like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with
nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in
their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN
employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type
proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible
solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty
quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial
transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms
of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the
incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we
expect.

### [7] [Few-Label Multimodal Modeling of SNP Variants and ECG Phenotypes Using Large Language Models for Cardiovascular Risk Stratification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16536)
*Niranjana Arun Menon,Yulong Li,Iqra Farooq,Sara Ahmed,Muhammad Awais,Imran Razzak*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的少标签多模态框架，用于心血管疾病风险分层，结合遗传和电生理信息，通过伪标签精炼和思维链推理提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病风险分层面临多因素性和高质量标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要有效整合基因组和电生理数据等不同模态信息。

Method: 使用大语言模型整合SNP变异和ECG特征，采用伪标签精炼策略从弱监督预测中提取高置信度标签，结合思维链推理生成临床相关解释。

Result: 实验结果显示多模态输入、少标签监督和思维链推理的结合提高了模型鲁棒性和泛化能力，性能可与全数据集训练模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的少标签多模态建模在个性化心血管护理方面具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification remains a major challenge
due to its multifactorial nature and limited availability of high-quality
labeled datasets. While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP
variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively
integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This
challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and
the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of
conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label
multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine
genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk
stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to
adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions,
enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth
annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of
Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically
relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate
that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT
reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient
profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived
features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full
dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling
for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.

*Akul Sharma,Anand A. Joshi,Richard M. Leahy*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散映射的束追踪框架，分析创伤性脑损伤后丘脑皮质连接的微观结构和组织变化，发现白质束的几何特征与功能预后相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创伤性脑损伤会破坏丘脑皮质连接，导致认知障碍和外伤后癫痫，需要更敏感的标记物来评估损伤严重程度和恢复轨迹。

Method: 开发基于扩散映射的束追踪框架，分析单个流线特征，捕捉丘脑白质通路的微观结构和组织变化。

Result: 发现扩散映射嵌入与功能预后评分显著相关，白质束的精细几何特征可能成为TBI相关改变的敏感标记物。

Conclusion: 白质束的几何特征为创伤性脑损伤的严重程度评估和恢复轨迹预测提供了潜在的生物标记物。

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disrupts thalamocortical connectivity,
contributing to cognitive impairment and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This
study presents a novel tractography-based framework that leverages diffusion
maps to capture microstructural and organizational changes in thalamic white
matter pathways. By analyzing individual streamline characteristics, we
identified significant associations between diffusion map embeddings and
functional outcomes (GOSE scores), highlighting potential biomarkers for injury
severity and recovery trajectories. Our findings suggest that fine-grained
geometric features of white matter tracts may provide a more sensitive marker
for TBI-related alterations.

*Yingxu Wang,Kunyu Zhang,Jiaxin Huang,Nan Yin,Siwei Liu,Eran Segal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoMol是一个原型引导的多模态分子表示学习框架，通过分层编码器和双向跨模态注意力机制，实现分子图与文本描述的细粒度整合和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法存在两个关键局限：仅在最终编码层进行跨模态交互，忽略了分层语义依赖；缺乏统一的原型空间来实现模态间的稳健对齐。

Method: 采用双分支分层编码器（GNN处理分子图，Transformer编码文本），引入分层双向跨模态注意力机制，构建共享原型空间与可学习的类特定锚点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，ProtoMol在各种分子性质预测任务中持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMol通过分层跨模态交互和原型引导的语义对齐，有效提升了多模态分子表示学习的预测准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

*Arielle Sanford,Shuo Sun,Christian B. Mendl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经常微分方程的连续深度Evoformer模型，用神经ODE参数化替代了AlphaFold中48个离散块，实现了恒定内存成本和计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold等蛋白质结构预测模型虽然强大，但其48层Evoformer架构存在高计算成本和刚性离散化问题，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 将Evoformer的48个离散块替换为神经ODE参数化，保持核心注意力操作，利用伴随方法实现恒定内存成本，通过自适应ODE求解器平衡运行时间和精度。

Result: 模型能够生成结构合理的蛋白质预测，可靠地捕捉α螺旋等二级结构元素，但精度未完全达到原始架构水平，训练时间大幅减少至单GPU 17.5小时。

Conclusion: 连续深度模型为生物分子建模提供了轻量级和可解释的替代方案，为高效自适应的蛋白质结构预测框架开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructureFlow是一个新颖的仿真自由方法，能够同时学习物理系统的结构和随机群体动力学，解决了现有方法难以同时处理结构学习和动力学建模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然系统中的物理系统（如细胞生物学）具有高维、随机特性，且只能获得部分噪声状态测量，这给建模系统动力学和推断网络结构带来了重大挑战。现有方法通常只能单独处理结构学习或群体层面的动力学建模。

Method: 提出了StructureFlow方法，这是一种基于原理的仿真自由方法，能够联合学习物理系统的结构和随机群体动力学。该方法适用于干预下的结构学习和条件群体动力学的轨迹推断任务。

Result: 在高维合成系统、生物模拟系统和实验单细胞数据集上的实证评估表明，StructureFlow能够同时学习底层系统的结构并建模其条件群体动力学。

Conclusion: StructureFlow能够同时学习系统结构和条件群体动力学，这是理解系统行为机制的关键步骤。

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

TL;DR: PUMBA是一个改进的蛋白质-蛋白质对接评分函数，用Vision Mamba架构替代了PIsToN中的Vision Transformer，在多个数据集上表现优于原模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质-蛋白质对接工具依赖准确的评分函数来区分天然和非天然复合物。Vision Mamba架构在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域表现出色，有望改进现有的Transformer-based模型。

Method: 将PIsToN中的Vision Transformer骨干网络替换为Vision Mamba架构，利用Mamba在图像块序列上的高效长程序列建模能力。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的大规模公共数据集上的评估表明，PUMBA始终优于其基于Transformer的前身PIsToN。

Conclusion: Vision Mamba架构能够显著提升模型捕捉蛋白质-蛋白质界面特征中全局和局部模式的能力，为蛋白质对接评分函数提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Result: 在3D打印的3椎体模型上进行针头插入试验，双ArUco标记跟踪提高了针头插入精度，减少了平均针头错位距离，与使用荧光透视的传统硬膜外技术平均偏差2mm相当。

Conclusion: 这种无辐射系统有望作为荧光透视的替代方案，改善图像引导的脊柱导航。

Abstract: Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle
placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this
paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal
pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans
of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh.
Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and
improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was
used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine
the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI
image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer
surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the
surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that
dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and
reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco
marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average
deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our
radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to
fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.

Abstract: The transport and localization of RNA molecules, crucial for cellular
function and development, involve a combination of diffusion and active
transport mechanisms. Here, we are motivated by understanding the dynamics of
RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching
(FRAP) is an experimental technique that is widely used to investigate the
dynamics of molecular movement within cells by observing the recovery of
fluorescence intensity in a photobleached region over time. To advance the
understanding of RNA dynamics, we develop a reaction-diffusion-advection
partial differential equation (PDE) model integrating both transport and
diffusion mechanisms. We propose a pipeline for identifiability analysis to
assess the model's ability to uniquely determine parameter values from observed
FRAP data. Based on profile likelihood analysis and reparametrization, we
examine the relationship between non- identifiable parameters, which improves
the robustness of parameter estimation. We find out that the identifiability of
the four parameters of interest is not exactly the same in different regions of
the cell. Specifically, transport velocity and diffusion coefficient are
identifiable in all regions of the cell, while some combinations of binding
rate and unbinding rate are found to be identifiable near the nucleus.
