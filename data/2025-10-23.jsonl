Achieving this\nvision requires the integration and interpretation of vast, heterogeneous\nbiomedical data within a meaningful scientific framework. Knowledge graphs,\nstructured according to biomedical ontologies, offer a powerful approach to\ncontextualize and interconnect diverse datasets, enabling more precise and\ninformed clinical decision-making.\n  We present ECKO (Explainable Clinical Knowledge for Oncology), a\ncomprehensive knowledge graph that integrates 33 biomedical ontologies and\naggregates data from multiple studies to create a unified resource optimized\nfor data-driven clinical applications in oncology. Designed to support\npersonalized drug recommendations, ECKO facilitates the identification of\noptimal therapeutic options by linking patient-specific molecular data to\nrelevant pharmacological knowledge. It provides transparent, interpretable\nexplanations for drug recommendations, fostering greater trust and\nunderstanding among clinicians and researchers. This resource represents a\nsignificant advancement toward explainable, scalable, and clinically actionable\npersonalized medicine in oncology, with potential applications in biomarker\ndiscovery, treatment optimization, and translational research."}

However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are\nnotoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning\nframework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from\nexperimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks,\nnormalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural\nstochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph.\nThis machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying\nbiological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train\nit compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking\nepithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only\ncaptures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states\nin their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately\ngenerate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly\nwing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the\nway for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts."}

The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually\nannotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy,\nexceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and\npredicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell\nlength, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of\nthe extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.

Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to\nperform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness\nremains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep\nSDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical\nframework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited\nobservational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and\nepistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with\nbroader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty\nquantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science\nobservations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian\ndeep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in\ndata-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and\nconservation efforts."}
