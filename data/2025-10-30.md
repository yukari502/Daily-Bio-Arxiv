Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 开发了Gosling Designer平台，用于编辑、探索和共享基因组学数据可视化，解决现有工具在多功能性、可视化创作、数据管理和协作共享方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI和计算方法在基因组学数据分析中取得进展，但仍需大量人工监督。现有可视化工具功能有限、缺乏交互性、开发困难且难以共享，阻碍了探索性分析。

Method: 开发了Gosling Designer这一一体化平台，通过集成编辑、探索和共享功能，专门针对基因组学数据可视化需求进行设计。

Result: 创建了一个能够解决现有工具四个关键挑战的平台：(1)多功能性不足，(2)可视化创作困难，(3)数据管理复杂，(4)协作共享障碍。

Conclusion: Gosling Designer为基因组学数据分析提供了一个全面解决方案，显著改善了数据可视化的可访问性、交互性和协作性。

Abstract: Analysis of genomics data is central to nearly all areas of modern biology.
Despite significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational
methods, these technologies require significant human oversight to generate
novel and reliable biological insights. Consequently, the genomics community
has developed a substantial number of diverse visualization approaches and a
proliferation of tools that biologists rely on in their data analysis
workflows. While there are a few commonly used visualization tools for genomics
data, many tools target specific use cases for genomics data interpretation and
offer only a limited, predefined set of visualization types. Moreover, static
visualizations often fail to support exploratory analysis. Developing
interactive visualizations and tools typically requires significant time and
technical expertise, even when supported by modern LLM-powered coding
assistants, and the resulting visualizations can be difficult to share among
collaborators. We developed Gosling Designer, an all-in-one platform for
editing, exploring, and sharing visualizations of genomics data. Gosling
Designer addresses four key challenges observed in existing genomics
visualization tools: (1) limited versatility, (2) difficulty of visualization
authoring, (3) complexity of data management, and (4) barriers to sharing and
collaboration.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: RNAGenScape是一个基于属性引导的流形Langevin动力学框架，用于mRNA序列优化设计，通过结构化潜在空间实现高效且生物学合理的探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mRNA设计和优化在合成生物学和治疗开发中很重要，但由于数据稀缺、不平衡以及复杂的序列-功能关系，在机器学习中研究不足。

Method: 结合组织化自编码器（结构化潜在空间）和流形投影器（将更新步骤收缩回流形），使用属性引导的流形Langevin动力学迭代更新mRNA序列。

Result: 在三个真实mRNA数据集上，RNAGenScape以高成功率和效率改善了目标属性，优于为蛋白质或非生物数据开发的各种生成或优化方法。

Conclusion: RNAGenScape为可控mRNA设计和mRNA序列建模中的潜在空间探索建立了一个可扩展的范式，通过提供连续的、数据对齐的轨迹来揭示编辑如何影响功能。

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.

*Alexandre St-Georges,Gabriel Richard,Maxime Toussaint,Christian Thibaudeau,Etienne Auger,Étienne Croteau,Stephen Cunnane,Roger Lecomte,Jean-Baptiste Michaud*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 使用条件去噪扩散概率模型从非衰减校正PET图像生成高质量CT图像，以替代传统CT扫描进行PET衰减校正，减少辐射暴露和设备成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PET/CT扫描需要额外的CT成像进行衰减校正，这会增加患者辐射暴露、存在空间配准问题且设备成本高昂。需要一种无额外辐射的方法来生成CT图像进行衰减校正。

Method: 采用条件去噪扩散概率模型，利用非衰减校正PET图像的三个正交视图，结合集成投票策略生成伪CT图像。

Result: 在159个头颈部扫描研究中，该方法生成的伪CT图像质量显著改善，CT图像的平均绝对误差为32±10.4 HU，PET重建图像在所有感兴趣区域的平均误差为(1.48±0.68)%。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的伪CT生成方法能够有效替代传统CT扫描进行PET衰减校正，在减少辐射暴露的同时保持高精度。

Abstract: Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential
for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue
encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution
of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching
detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal
degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to
differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to
misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed
Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon
attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to
extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial
misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment
infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an
alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation
reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can
generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in
order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from
non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble
voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and
improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans
acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method
achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an
average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when
comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated
pseudo-CT versus the true CT.

### [4] [General Microstructure Factor Analysis of Diffusion MRI in Gray-Matter Predicts Cognitive Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24879)
*Lucas Z. Brito,Ryan P. Cabeen,David H. Laidlaw*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究使用扩散MRI和NODDI技术探索灰质微观结构的全局模式，发现基于PCA的灰质微观结构指标能够预测认知表现，特别是各向同性体积分数因子与阅读、词汇和认知流畅性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散MRI在白质微观结构研究中已有重要发现，但在灰质应用相对较少。本研究旨在探索灰质微观结构的全局模式是否能够通过NODDI技术捕捉，并预测认知表现。

Method: 使用人类连接组计划年轻成人研究的扩散MRI和行为数据，计算区域平均NODDI参数，应用主成分分析构建灰质微观结构的通用因子。

Result: 研究发现各向同性体积分数因子解释了显著的个体间变异性，并与NIH工具箱的特定认知分数显著相关，特别是与阅读、词汇表现和认知流畅性相关。

Conclusion: 灰质微观结构的通用因子可作为研究认知和皮层组织的稳健、可解释的生物标志物，为群体水平的研究提供了补充性标记。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI has revealed important insights into white matter
microstructure, but its application to gray matter remains comparatively less
explored. Here, we investigate whether global patterns of gray-matter
microstructure can be captured through neurite orientation dispersion and
density imaging (NODDI) and whether such patterns are predictive of cognitive
performance. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based global indicators of
gray-matter microstructure provide complementary markers of structure-function
relationships, extending beyond region-specific analyses. Our results suggest
that general microstructure factors may serve as robust, interpretable
biomarkers for studying cognition and cortical organization at the population
level. Using diffusion MRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome
Project Young Adult study, we derived region-averaged NODDI parameters and
applied principal component analysis (PCA) to construct general gray-matter
microstructure factors. We found that the factor derived from isotropic volume
fraction explained substantial inter-individual variability and was
significantly correlated with specific cognitive scores collected from the NIH
Toolbox. In particular, the isotropic volume fraction factor was linked to
reading and vocabulary performance and to cognitive fluidity.

### [5] [scMRDR: A scalable and flexible framework for unpaired single-cell multi-omics data integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24987)

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出scMRDR框架，用于无配对多组学单细胞数据整合，通过解耦模态共享和模态特异性表示，结合多种正则化策略实现可扩展的多组学整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞测序技术发展迅速，但无配对多组学数据整合仍具挑战性。现有方法依赖配对信息或需要计算全局配对矩阵，限制了可扩展性和灵活性。

Method: 使用β-VAE架构解耦模态共享和模态特异性表示，结合等距正则化保持组学内异质性、对抗目标促进跨模态对齐、掩码重建损失处理缺失特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出优异的批次校正、模态对齐和生物学信号保持性能，可有效扩展到大规模数据集并支持多于两种组学的整合。

Conclusion: scMRDR为大规模多组学数据整合和下游生物学发现提供了强大而灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled high-resolution profiling of
diverse molecular modalities, while integrating unpaired multi-omics
single-cell data remains challenging. Existing approaches either rely on pair
information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise
coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we
introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell
Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired
multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell's latent
representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a
well-designed $\beta$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric
regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial
objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss
strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method
achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch
correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially,
it scales effectively to large-level datasets and supports integration of more
than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale
multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化收缩性细胞单层中的细胞间机械力，理解机械力在调节细胞集体行为中的作用，特别是在肌生成、形态发生和集体组织中的物理基础。

Method: 整合牵引力显微镜和数值模拟，重建C2C12成肌细胞单层中的应力分布，分析应力模式与拓扑缺陷、细胞排列、密度和形态的关系。

Result: 发现收缩性单层表现出正最大和负最小主应力，反映活性张力的内在各向异性；不同应力模式出现在拓扑缺陷周围，与细胞排列、密度和形态的奇点重合；拉伸应力优先沿细胞伸长轴传递，压缩应力横向传递。

Conclusion: 建立了一个量化框架来表征活性细胞单层中的机械各向异性，揭示了力-结构耦合的普遍原理，为理解力学如何调控肌生成、形态发生和收缩性细胞系统中的集体组织提供了物理基础。

Abstract: Collective behaviors in cellular systems are regulated not only by
biochemical signalling pathways but also by intercellular mechanical forces,
whose quantification in contractile monolayers remains poorly understood. Here,
by integrating traction force microscopy and numerical simulations, we
reconstruct the stress distribution in C2C12 myoblast monolayers to reveal the
roles of local mechanical forces in determining the collective cellular
structures. We find that contractile monolayers exhibit positive maximum and
negative minimum principal stresses, reflecting the intrinsic anisotropy of
active tension. Distinct stress patterns emerge around topological defects,
coinciding with singularities in cell alignment, density, and morphology,
indicating a strong coupling between mechanical forces and structural
organization. Moreover, tensile stresses are preferentially transmitted along
the cell elongation axis and compressive stresses transversely, demonstrating
that local stress guides cell arrangement. This mechanical guidance appears to
be universal among contractile systems, as observed also in bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells. Together, our work establishes a quantitative framework
for characterizing mechanical anisotropy in active cellular monolayers and
reveals a general principle of force-structure coupling, providing a physical
basis for understanding how mechanics governs myogenesis, morphogenesis, and
collective organization in contractile cellular systems.

### [7] [geohabnet: An R package for mapping habitat connectivity for biosecurity and conservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24955)

Conclusion: geohabnet提供了一个快速、开源、可重复的基准工具，用于量化物种栖息地连通性，支持跨边界病原体、害虫或濒危物种的管理优先排序。

Abstract: Mapping habitat quality, based on factors like host availability and
environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations
are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes
geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations
in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with
high habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are
geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a
major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that
would otherwise be physically fragmented.
  Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential
importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes.
geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat
availability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat
connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or
pollinators.
  geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network
centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples
using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in
Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply
geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated
importance of geographic locations for species spread.
  geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to
quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic
scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through
habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science,
and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary
pathogens, pests, or endangered species.
