Abstract: Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face
limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of
data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have
emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage
density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of
mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its
accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and
the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides
directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy
indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this
work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates
sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry
environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.
In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are
easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as
follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset
containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond
cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million
labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy
that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent
test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods
in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a
strong foundation for sequence optimization.

### [2] [A Proposed Framework for Quantifying AI-to-Clinical Translation: The Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26685)
*Xiyao Yu,Kai Fu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究提出了算法-结果一致性(AOC)指标，用于评估AI预测的新抗原疫苗与临床结果之间的转化保真度，分析显示AOC值在0.42-0.79之间，高肿瘤突变负荷和克隆新抗原优势与更好的转化保真度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏评估AI预测模型与临床结果之间转化保真度的一致框架，需要建立定量指标来桥接计算预测与临床疗效。

Method: 系统分析了2017-2025年间6项黑色素瘤疫苗试验，引入AOC指标（结合模型性能AUC与临床疗效HR/ORR），并整合机制、经济和监管视角。

Result: 模拟AOC值范围为0.42-0.79，显示算法预测与观察结果之间存在异质性一致性；高肿瘤突变负荷和克隆新抗原优势与改善的转化保真度相关；经济模型显示AOC>0.7可使ICER降至10万美元/QALY以下。

Conclusion: 该框架定量桥接了AI驱动的新抗原预测与临床转化，为未来个性化疫苗验证和监管标准化提供了可重复的指标，AOC可作为假设生成工具。

Abstract: Background: The rapid evolution of personalized neoantigen vaccines has been
accelerated by artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models. Yet, a
consistent framework to evaluate the translational fidelity between
computational predictions and clinical outcomes remains lacking. Methods: This
systematic synthesis analyzed six melanoma vaccine trials conducted between
2017 and 2025 across mRNA, peptide, and dendritic cell platforms. We introduced
the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) metric - a quantitative measure
linking model performance (AUC) with clinical efficacy (HR/ORR) - and
integrated mechanistic, economic, and regulatory perspectives. Results:
Simulated AOC values across studies ranged from 0.42-0.79, suggesting
heterogeneous concordance between algorithmic prediction and observed outcomes.
High tumor mutational burden and clonal neoantigen dominance correlated with
improved translational fidelity. Economic modeling suggested that achieving AOC
>0.7 could reduce ICER below $100,000/QALY. Conclusions: This framework
quantitatively bridges AI-driven neoantigen prediction with clinical
translation, offering a reproducible metric for future personalized vaccine
validation and regulatory standardization. This study presents AOC as a
hypothesis-generating tool, with all computations based on simulated or
aggregated trial data for demonstration purposes only.

### [3] [On the number of non-degenerate canalizing Boolean functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26556)
*Claus Kadelka*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 本文推导了计算具有特定数量本质变量和给定渠化性质的布尔函数的递归公式，特别确定了非退化渠化布尔函数的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渠化是复杂系统特别是基因调控网络中的关键组织原则，描述某些输入变量对函数输出的主导控制，但渠化和退化性的组合基础尚未被完全理解。

Method: 使用递归公式来计数布尔函数，特别关注具有规定数量本质变量和渠化性质的函数，扩展了先前关于渠化和嵌套渠化函数的枚举结果。

Result: 确定了非退化渠化布尔函数的数量，为量化渠化在随机布尔函数中的出现频率提供了严格基础。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于评估渠化在生物网络模型中的显著过度表征，渠化既有助于鲁棒性，也有助于不同调控角色的出现。

Abstract: Canalization is a key organizing principle in complex systems, particularly
in gene regulatory networks. It describes how certain input variables exert
dominant control over a function's output, thereby imposing hierarchical
structure and conferring robustness to perturbations. Degeneracy, in contrast,
captures redundancy among input variables and reflects the complete dominance
of some variables by others. Both properties influence the stability and
dynamics of discrete dynamical systems, yet their combinatorial underpinnings
remain incompletely understood. Here, we derive recursive formulas for counting
Boolean functions with prescribed numbers of essential variables and given
canalizing properties. In particular, we determine the number of non-degenerate
canalizing Boolean functions -- that is, functions for which all variables are
essential and at least one variable is canalizing. Our approach extends earlier
enumeration results on canalizing and nested canalizing functions. It provides
a rigorous foundation for quantifying how frequently canalization occurs among
random Boolean functions and for assessing its pronounced over-representation
in biological network models, where it contributes to both robustness and to
the emergence of distinct regulatory roles.

### [4] [InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943)
*Ann Huang,Mitchell Ostrow,Satpreet H. Singh,Leo Kozachkov,Ila Fiete,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: InputDSA是一种新的度量方法，用于比较具有输入驱动的动力系统的内在和外部驱动动态，解决了DSA方法无法处理输入影响的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DSA方法只考虑系统内在动态，忽略了输入对系统行为的影响。由于现实世界中的动力系统很少是自主的，需要一种能够同时考虑内在动态和输入驱动的方法来更准确地比较系统相似性。

Method: 基于子空间识别的动态模式分解控制变体(DMDc)来估计和比较输入和内在动态算子，扩展了DSA框架。

Result: InputDSA能够成功比较部分观测、输入驱动的噪声系统；在真实输入未知时，使用替代输入不会显著影响相似性估计；在强化学习训练的RNN中，高性能网络动态相似，低性能网络动态多样；在老鼠神经数据中识别出从输入驱动证据积累到内在驱动决策的转变。

Conclusion: InputDSA是一种鲁棒且高效的方法，能够比较动力系统的内在动态和外部输入影响，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare
observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural
systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and
deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical
Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems
based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However,
DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar
systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because
real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account
for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for
comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA
(iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both
input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We
demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed,
input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are
unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in
similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing
networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks
are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats
performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from
input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our
work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing
intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.
