Motivation: 挑战传统假设，即简化模型在时间尺度分离下能准确估计相干性和互信息率，揭示简化模型在这些指标上的局限性。

Method: 通过分析酶催化和基因表达等典型模型，研究简化模型与完整模型在相干性谱和互信息率估计上的差异。

Result: 简化模型虽然能忠实再现分子计数的低阶统计量，但在相干性谱上存在显著差异，特别是在中高频率，导致互信息率估计出现重大误差。

Conclusion: 简化模型在相干性和互信息率估计上的误差源于反应网络结构、模型简化方法和渐近极限之间的相互作用，这对细胞信息流量化具有实际意义。

Abstract: Simplified stochastic models are widely used in the study of
frequency-resolved noise propagation in biochemical reaction networks, a common
measure being the coherence between random fluctuations in molecule number
trajectories. Such models have also found widespread application in the
quantification of how information is transmitted in reaction networks via the
mutual information (MI) rate. A common assumption is that, under timescale
separation, estimates for the coherence and MI rate obtained from simplified
(reduced) models closely approximate those in the underlying full models. Here,
we challenge that assumption by showing that, while reduced models can
faithfully reproduce low-order statistics of molecular counts, they frequently
incur substantial discrepancies in the coherence spectrum, especially at
intermediate and high frequencies. These errors, in turn, lead to significant
inaccuracies in the resulting estimates for the MI rates. We show that the
observed discrepancies are due to the interplay between the structure of the
underlying reaction networks, the specific model reduction method that is
applied, and the asymptotic limits relating the full and the reduced models. We
illustrate our results in canonical models of enzyme catalysis and gene
expression, highlighting practical implications for quantifying information
flow in cells.

Abstract: Ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics relies on magnetic field gradients to
manipulate diamagnetic particles in ferrofluid-filled microenvironments. It has
emerged as a promising tool for label-free manipulation of bioparticles,
including their separation and phenotyping. This perspective reviews recent
progress in the development and applications of ferrofluid-based microfluidic
platforms for multiscale bioparticle separation, ranging from micron-scale
cells to submicron extracellular vesicles. We highlight the fundamental
physical principles for ferrohydrodynamic manipulation, including the dominant
magnetic buoyancy force resulting from the interaction of ferrofluids and
particles. We then describe how these principles enable high-resolution
size-based bioparticle separation, subcellular bioparticle enrichment, and
phenotypic screening based on physical traits. We also discuss key challenges
in ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics from the aspects of ferrofluid
biocompatibility, system throughput, and nanoparticle depletion. Finally, we
outline future research directions involving machine learning, 3D printing, and
multiplexed detection. These insights chart a path for advancing
ferrofluid-based technologies in precision biomedicine, diagnostics, and
cellular engineering.
