To this day, various models have been\nproposed to explain how fingerprints are formed, ranging from the fibroblast\nmodel, which focuses on cell-collagen interactions, to the buckling of thin\nlayers model, both yielding significant results. In this work, we present a\nreaction-diffusion model of Schnakenberg type, featuring an anisotropic\ndiffusion matrix that follows the ridge orientations supplied by other\ntraditional fingerprint-generation models, and notably yet allows minutiae --\ni.e. characteristic microstructures embedded in fingerprints -- to emerge. The\nstatistical analysis of the minutiae distribution in a randomly generated\nfingerprint collection is consistent with observations in real fingerprints.\nThe model can numerically generate fingerprint-like patterns corresponding to\nthe four basic classifications -- arches, ulnar loops, radial loops, and whorls\n-- as well as a variety of derived forms. The generated patterns emerge on a\nconvex domain that mimics the geometry of a fingertip, exhibiting the diverse\ntypes of minutiae typically analyzed in fingerprint identification and showing\nstrong agreement with those observed in human fingerprints. This model also\nprovides insight into how levels of certainty in human identification can be\nachieved when based on minutiae positions. All the algorithms are implemented\nin an open source software named GenCHSin."}

We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to\nenforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative\ntrajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed\nmanifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising\nscores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This\nphysics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological\npriors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.\nRigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean\nSquare Deviation of 0.99 {\\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%\nimprovement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest\nreported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%.

However, a major cause of design failures is the\ninability to find solutions within realistic time limits. Therefore, it is\nessential to develop methods that achieve a high success rate within the\nspecified computation time. In this study, we propose a framework for ranking\nthe importance of individual genes to accelerate the solution of the original\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems in the design of\nconstraint-based models. In the proposed method, after pre-assigning values to\nhighly important genes, the MILPs are solved in parallel as a series of\nmutually exclusive subproblems. It is found that our framework was able to\nrecover most of the successful cases identified by the original approach and\nachieved a 37% to 186% increase in success rate compared to the original method\nwithin the same time limits. Analysis of the MILP solution process revealed\nthat the proposed method reduced the sizes of subproblems and decreased the\nnumber of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. This framework for ranking gene\nimportance can be directly applicable to a range of MILP-based algorithms for\nthe design of constraint-based metabolic networks.
