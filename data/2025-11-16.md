### [1] [General Intelligence-based Fragmentation (GIF): A framework for peak-labeled spectra simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09571)
*Margaret R. Martin,Soha Hassoun*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: GIF框架通过结构化提示和推理指导预训练大语言模型进行质谱模拟，在质谱注释任务中优于其他模型和深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有不断增长的参考库和先进计算工具，代谢组学领域仍受限于质谱注释率低的问题。大语言模型在生成和推理任务中的优异表现激发了将其应用于质谱注释等科学挑战的兴趣。

Method: GIF框架使用标记、结构化输入/输出、系统提示、基于指令的提示和迭代优化来指导预训练LLMs进行质谱模拟。在MassSpecGym QA-sim数据集上评估模型性能。

Result: GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在模拟谱与真实谱之间的余弦相似度分别达到0.36和0.35，优于GPT-5、Llama-3.1和ChemDFM等模型，也优于多个深度学习基线方法。

Conclusion: GIF框架不仅可用于质谱模拟，还能实现人机协作工作流程和分子碎片化的结构化、可解释推理，突显了在复杂科学任务中系统指导LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Despite growing reference libraries and advanced computational tools, progress in the field of metabolomics remains constrained by low rates of annotating measured spectra. The recent developments of large language models (LLMs) have led to strong performance across a wide range of generation and reasoning tasks, spurring increased interest in LLMs' application to domain-specific scientific challenges, such as mass spectra annotation. Here, we present a novel framework, General Intelligence-based Fragmentation (GIF), that guides pretrained LLMs through spectra simulation using structured prompting and reasoning. GIF utilizes tagging, structured inputs/outputs, system prompts, instruction-based prompts, and iterative refinement. Indeed, GIF offers a structured alternative to ad hoc prompting, underscoring the need for systematic guidance of LLMs on complex scientific tasks. Using GIF, we evaluate current generalist LLMs' ability to use reasoning towards fragmentation and to perform intensity prediction after fine-tuning. We benchmark performance on a novel QA dataset, the MassSpecGym QA-sim dataset, that we derive from the MassSpecGym dataset. Through these implementations of GIF, we find that GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve a cosine similarity of 0.36 and 0.35 between the simulated and true spectra, respectively, outperforming other pretrained models including GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and ChemDFM, despite GPT-5's recency and ChemDFM's domain specialization. GIF outperforms several deep learning baselines. Our evaluation of GIF highlights the value of using LLMs not only for spectra simulation but for enabling human-in-the-loop workflows and structured, explainable reasoning in molecular fragmentation.

### [2] [Prostate-VarBench: A Benchmark with Interpretable TabNet Framework for Prostate Cancer Variant Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09576)
*Abraham Francisco Arellano Tavara,Umesh Kumar,Jathurshan Pradeepkumar,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了Prostate-VarBench，一个前列腺癌特异性基因组变异基准数据集，整合了多个数据库的193,278个变异，并训练了可解释的TabNet模型用于变异致病性分类，准确率达89.9%，VUS减少6.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决前列腺癌基因组学中意义未明变异(VUS)问题，这些变异因致病性或良性证据不完整而延迟诊断和治疗，同时缺乏前列腺特异性基准和一致注释限制了进展。

Method: 创建前列腺特异性基准管道，整合COSMIC、ClinVar和TCGA-PRAD数据；修正VEP转录本合并问题；标准化56个可解释特征；纳入AlphaMissense致病性评分；训练可解释TabNet模型进行变异分类。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到89.9%准确率，VEP修正使VUS绝对减少6.5%；构建了包含193,278个变异的前列腺特异性基准数据集。

Conclusion: Prostate-VarBench为前列腺癌变异分类提供了标准化基准，TabNet模型通过可解释的逐步稀疏掩码提供临床相关理由，显著减少了VUS不确定性。

Abstract: Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) limit the clinical utility of prostate cancer genomics by delaying diagnosis and therapy when evidence for pathogenicity or benignity is incomplete. Progress is further limited by inconsistent annotations across sources and the absence of a prostate-specific benchmark for fair comparison. We introduce Prostate-VarBench, a curated pipeline for creating prostate-specific benchmarks that integrates COSMIC (somatic cancer mutations), ClinVar (expert-curated clinical variants), and TCGA-PRAD (prostate tumor genomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas) into a harmonized dataset of 193,278 variants supporting patient- or gene-aware splits to prevent data leakage. To ensure data integrity, we corrected a Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) issue that merged multiple transcript records, introducing ambiguity in clinical significance fields. We then standardized 56 interpretable features across eight clinically relevant tiers, including population frequency, variant type, and clinical context. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores were incorporated to enhance missense variant classification and reduce VUS uncertainty. Building on this resource, we trained an interpretable TabNet model to classify variant pathogenicity, whose step-wise sparse masks provide per-case rationales consistent with molecular tumor board review practices. On the held-out test set, the model achieved 89.9% accuracy with balanced class metrics, and the VEP correction yields an 6.5% absolute reduction in VUS.

### [3] [Exhaustive Investigation of CBC-Derived Biomarker Ratios for Clinical Outcome Prediction: The RDW-to-MCHC Ratio as a Novel Mortality Predictor in Critical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09583)
*Dmytro Leontiev,Abicumaran Uthamacumaran,Riya Nagar,Hector Zenil*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: RDW:MCHC比值是从血常规参数中筛选出的最佳死亡率预测生物标志物，在ICU患者中表现出良好的预测性能、通用性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重症监护中早期风险分层常受限于复杂评分系统的延迟可用性，而血常规参数在入院几小时内即可获得，可能实现快速预后评估。

Method: 对超过9万例ICU入院患者进行系统性评估，生成所有可行的两参数血常规比值，通过交叉验证和外部验证评估区分度、校准和临床效用。

Result: RDW:MCHC比值在发现队列中AUC为0.699，验证队列中为0.662，优于RDW和NLR，且可用性高达99.9%，校准良好，OR=3.81。

Conclusion: RDW:MCHC比值是一个简单、广泛可用的血常规衍生特征，为早期死亡风险提供一致且外部验证的信号，可作为快速分诊的实用辅助工具。

Abstract: Ratios of common biomarkers and blood analytes are well established for early detection and predictive purposes. Early risk stratification in critical care is often limited by the delayed availability of complex severity scores. Complete blood count (CBC) parameters, available within hours of admission, may enable rapid prognostication. We conducted an exhaustive and systematic evaluation of CBC-derived ratios for mortality prediction to identify robust, accessible, and generalizable biomarkers. We generated all feasible two-parameter CBC ratios with unit checks and plausibility filters on more than 90,000 ICU admissions (MIMIC-IV). Discrimination was assessed via cross-validated and external AUC, calibration via isotonic regression, and clinical utility with decision-curve analysis. Retrospective validation was performed on eICU-CRD (n = 156530) participants. The ratio of Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) to Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), denoted RDW:MCHC, emerged as the top biomarker (AUC = 0.699 discovery; 0.662 validation), outperforming RDW and NLR. It achieved near-universal availability (99.9\% vs.\ 35.0\% for NLR), excellent calibration (Hosmer--Lemeshow $p = 1.0$; $\mathrm{ECE} < 0.001$), and preserved performance across diagnostic groups, with only modest attenuation in respiratory cases. Expressed as a logistic odds ratio, each one standard deviation increase in RDW:MCHC nearly quadrupled 30-day mortality odds (OR = 3.81, 95\% CI [3.70, 3.95]). Decision-curve analysis showed positive net benefit at high-risk triage thresholds. A simple, widely available CBC-derived feature (RDW:MCHC) provides consistent, externally validated signal for early mortality risk. While not a substitute for multivariable scores, it offers a pragmatic adjunct for rapid triage when full scoring is impractical.

### [4] [fastbmRAG: A Fast Graph-Based RAG Framework for Efficient Processing of Large-Scale Biomedical Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10014)
*Guofeng Meng,Li Shen,Qiuyan Zhong,Wei Wang,Haizhou Zhang,Xiaozhen Wang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: fastbmRAG是一个针对生物医学文献优化的快速图基检索增强生成系统，通过两阶段知识图谱构建（摘要草稿+正文精炼）实现10倍速度提升，同时保持高覆盖率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基RAG系统在生物医学领域计算密集，限制了其在大规模数据集上的应用，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用生物医学论文结构特点，采用两阶段知识图谱构建：先用摘要构建草稿图，再用正文通过向量实体链接进行精炼，减少冗余和计算负担。

Result: fastbmRAG比现有图基RAG工具快10倍以上，在知识覆盖率和准确性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: fastbmRAG为大规模生物医学文献的快速理解、总结和问答提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming various domains, including biomedicine and healthcare, and demonstrate remarkable potential from scientific research to new drug discovery. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as a useful application of LLMs, can improve contextual reasoning through structured entity and relationship identification from long-context knowledge, e.g. biomedical literature. Even though many advantages over naive RAGs, most of graph-based RAGs are computationally intensive, which limits their application to large-scale dataset. To address this issue, we introduce fastbmRAG, an fast graph-based RAG optimized for biomedical literature. Utilizing well organized structure of biomedical papers, fastbmRAG divides the construction of knowledge graph into two stages, first drafting graphs using abstracts; and second, refining them using main texts guided by vector-based entity linking, which minimizes redundancy and computational load. Our evaluations demonstrate that fastbmRAG is over 10x faster than existing graph-RAG tools and achieve superior coverage and accuracy to input knowledge. FastbmRAG provides a fast solution for quickly understanding, summarizing, and answering questions about biomedical literature on a large scale. FastbmRAG is public available in https://github.com/menggf/fastbmRAG.

*Alexander Ingold,Richard G. Baird,Dasmeet Kaur,Nidhi Dwivedi,Reed Sorenson,Leslie Sieburth,Chang-Jun Liu,Rajesh Menon*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: HAMscope是一种紧凑型快照式高光谱自发荧光微型显微镜，通过集成聚合物扩散器和深度学习框架，实现实时无标记分子成像，可重建30通道高光谱数据或直接推断分子组成图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够实时进行无标记分子成像的紧凑型高光谱显微镜，适用于各种生物系统，解决传统高光谱成像设备体积庞大、成本高昂的问题。

Method: 在宽场微型显微镜中集成薄聚合物扩散器进行光谱编码，采用概率深度学习框架，使用具有transformer注意力和逐像素不确定性估计的可扩展多通道U-Net架构。

Result: 实现了高时空光谱保真度（平均绝对误差约0.0048），视频速率成像，在植物系统中成功成像木质素、叶绿素和木栓质，系统可泛化到分布外组织类型，支持无需光谱解混的直接分子映射。

Conclusion: HAMscope建立了一个紧凑、不确定性感知的光谱成像通用框架，结合最小化光学器件和先进深度学习，为神经科学、环境监测和生物医学中的实时生化成像提供广泛实用性。

Abstract: We introduce HAMscope, a compact, snapshot hyperspectral autofluorescence miniscope that enables real-time, label-free molecular imaging in a wide range of biological systems. By integrating a thin polymer diffuser into a widefield miniscope, HAMscope spectrally encodes each frame and employs a probabilistic deep learning framework to reconstruct 30-channel hyperspectral stacks (452 to 703 nm) or directly infer molecular composition maps from single images. A scalable multi-pass U-Net architecture with transformer-based attention and per-pixel uncertainty estimation enables high spatio-spectral fidelity (mean absolute error ~ 0.0048) at video rates. While initially demonstrated in plant systems, including lignin, chlorophyll, and suberin imaging in intact poplar and cork tissues, the platform is readily adaptable to other applications such as neural activity mapping, metabolic profiling, and histopathology. We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing. HAMscope establishes a general framework for compact, uncertainty-aware spectral imaging that combines minimal optics with advanced deep learning, offering broad utility for real-time biochemical imaging across neuroscience, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine.

*Yuancheng Sun,Yuxuan Ren,Zhaoming Chen,Xu Han,Kang Liu,Qiwei Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPO是一种在线优化算法，将预训练的蛋白质构象集成生成器转化为能量感知采样器，无需额外MD轨迹，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学模拟计算成本高且易陷入能量陷阱，需要更高效的方法来探索蛋白质构象集成。

Method: 使用随机微分方程采样探索构象空间，结合基于列表偏好优化的能量排序机制，引入实用上界近似连续时间生成模型中难以处理的概率。

Result: 在Tetrapeptides、ATLAS和Fast-Folding基准测试中，EPO在九个评估指标上达到最先进水平，生成多样且物理真实的构象集成。

Conclusion: 仅使用能量偏好信号就能有效引导生成模型产生热力学一致的构象集成，为长MD模拟提供了替代方案，扩展了学习势能在结构生物学和药物发现中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

*David F. Anderson,Aidan S. Howells,Diego Rojas La Luz*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 本文研究了内容介导的区室动力学，其中区室分裂速率取决于其内部特定物种的丰度，提供了非爆炸性和正递归性的充分条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞反应通常在区室化环境中进行，现有模型假设区室动力学独立于其内容物，但实际中区室分裂往往受内部物种影响，需要建立更一般的理论框架。

Method: 在假设基础化学反应网络存在线性Lyapunov函数的前提下，建立数学模型分析内容依赖型区室分裂的随机动力学行为。

Result: 证明了Anderson和Howells的爆炸性特征化在此设置下失效，并提供了新的非爆炸性和正递归性充分条件。

Conclusion: 扩展了内容介导区室动力学的理论基础，对细胞分裂和细胞内运输等系统建模具有重要意义。

Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks with mass-action kinetics provide a useful framework for understanding processes -- biochemical and otherwise -- in homogeneous environments. However, cellular reactions are often compartmentalized, either at the cell level or within cells, and hence non-homogeneous. A general framework for compartmentalized chemistry with dynamic compartments was proposed in (Duso and Zechner, PNAS, 2020), and the special case where the compartment dynamics do not depend on their contents was studied mathematically in (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023). In the present paper, we investigate the case in which the rate of fragmentation of a compartment depends on the abundance of some designated species inside that compartment. The main focus of this work is on providing general conditions for (positive) recurrence and non-explosivity of the models. In particular, we demonstrate that the explosivity characterization from (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023) fails in this setting and provide new sufficient conditions for non-explosivity and positive recurrence, under the assumption that the underlying CRN admits a linear Lyapunov function. These results extend the theoretical foundation for modeling content-mediated compartment dynamics, with implications for systems such as cell division and intracellular transport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数字病理学基于网格切分忽略组织结构，引入无关信息且限制可解释性

Method: 使用语义分割提取腺体作为输入补丁，应用于多实例学习和表型分析

Result: 腺体分割Dice得分0.83，在760个WSI中提取38万个腺体，MIL模型AUC提升10%，识别出15个腺体簇与癌症复发相关

Conclusion: HIT通过聚焦生物意义结构，提高了MIL预测的准确性和可解释性，同时简化了计算

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: 研究半开放网络中n位点顺序磷酸化-去磷酸化循环的多稳态性，发现开放底物物种保留多稳态能力，而开放酶物种会破坏多稳态性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多稳态性是生化开关和细胞决策的基础，研究在部分物种允许与环境交换的半开放网络中，多稳态性如何受到影响。

Method: 采用质量作用动力学，通过结合绝对浓度稳健性检测和剩余物种投影的通用简化框架进行分析。

Result: 开放任何非空底物子集保留非退化多稳态性；开放酶物种（激酶和磷酸酶）总是破坏多稳态性。

Conclusion: 酶开放作为稳健开关将潜在多稳态磷酸化模块转换为单稳态，而底物交换保留切换能力，便于与下游过程耦合。

Abstract: Multistationarity, underlies biochemical switching and cellular decision-making. We study how multistationarity in the sequential n-site phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is affected when only some species are open, meaning allowed to exchange with the environment (so-called semi-open networks). Working under mass action kinetics, we obtain two complementary structural results for every $n\geq 2$. First, opening any nonempty subset of the substrate species preserves the network's capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. Second, opening the enzyme species (both kinase and phosphatase), possibly together with any subset of substrates, always destroys multistationarity. The latter result is proved by a general reduction framework combining the detection of absolute concentration robustness (ACR) with projection onto the remaining species; when the projection is monostationary, the full semi-open system is monostationary. We also illustrate the general method on multi-layer cascade variants and discuss biological implications: opening enzymes acts as a robust switch that converts a potentially multistationary phosphorylation module into a monostationary one, while substrate exchange preserves switching capacity and thus the ability to couple cycles to downstream processes.

Method: 采用随机热力学框架，基于通用动力学模型分析首次通过时间的涨落定理，并通过酶模型验证理论结果。

Result: 当熵产生保持恒定（即随机熵和机器自由能变化平衡）时，首次通过时间涨落定理成立；违反该定理可作为隐藏详细平衡破坏的实验可检测特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了复杂合作网络中随机热力学量与动力学测量之间的重要联系，为驱动粗粒化系统的热力学分析提供了新见解。

Abstract: We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胸部X光分类方法主要依赖单视图图像级输入，忽略了临床实践中可用的结构化临床信息和多图像研究，无法反映临床医生的诊断决策过程。

Method: 使用视图特定的ConvNeXt编码器处理正面和侧面胸片，通过Transformer融合模块将图像特征与临床指征、病史和生命体征等结构化数据融合。

Result: 在原始MIMIC-CXR数据集和更新的CXR-LT基准测试中均超越了现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 基于临床的多模态对齐对于推进胸部X光分类具有重要价值，能够生成反映临床实践推理的情境感知表示。

Abstract: Radiology is essential to modern healthcare, yet rising demand and staffing shortages continue to pose major challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to support radiologists and help address these challenges. Given its widespread use and clinical importance, chest X-ray classification is well suited to augment radiologists' workflows. However, most existing approaches rely solely on single-view, image-level inputs, ignoring the structured clinical information and multi-image studies available at the time of reporting. In this work, we introduce CaMCheX, a multimodal transformer-based framework that aligns multi-view chest X-ray studies with structured clinical data to better reflect how clinicians make diagnostic decisions. Our architecture employs view-specific ConvNeXt encoders for frontal and lateral chest radiographs, whose features are fused with clinical indications, history, and vital signs using a transformer fusion module. This design enables the model to generate context-aware representations that mirror reasoning in clinical practice. Our results exceed the state of the art for both the original MIMIC-CXR dataset and the more recent CXR-LT benchmarks, highlighting the value of clinically grounded multimodal alignment for advancing chest X-ray classification.

TL;DR: 提出了nnQC框架，一种基于扩散生成范式的自适应质量控制系统，能够处理任何输入器官数据集，通过专家团队架构结合空间和视觉信息生成伪真实标签来预测质量分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习医学图像分割方法容易产生幻觉导致解剖学上不合理的分割结果，而现有质量控制方法都是器官特定的，缺乏通用性和可用性。

Method: 提出nnQC框架，采用专家团队架构，两个专家分别编码3D空间意识和解剖信息，通过加权条件模块动态结合这些信息，在扩散过程中生成空间感知的伪真实标签来预测质量分数。

Result: 在7个器官的12个公开数据集上评估，nnQC在所有实验中一致优于现有最先进方法，包括分割掩码严重退化或完全缺失的情况。

Conclusion: nnQC框架具有跨器官、数据集和成像模态的适应能力，证实了其在不同器官间的多功能性和有效性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation using deep learning (DL) has enabled the development of automated analysis pipelines for large-scale population studies. However, state-of-the-art DL methods are prone to hallucinations, which can result in anatomically implausible segmentations. With manual correction impractical at scale, automated quality control (QC) techniques have to address the challenge. While promising, existing QC methods are organ-specific, limiting their generalizability and usability beyond their original intended task. To overcome this limitation, we propose no-new Quality Control (nnQC), a robust QC framework based on a diffusion-generative paradigm that self-adapts to any input organ dataset. Central to nnQC is a novel Team of Experts (ToE) architecture, where two specialized experts independently encode 3D spatial awareness, represented by the relative spatial position of an axial slice, and anatomical information derived from visual features from the original image. A weighted conditional module dynamically combines the pair of independent embeddings, or opinions to condition the sampling mechanism within a diffusion process, enabling the generation of a spatially aware pseudo-ground truth for predicting QC scores. Within its framework, nnQC integrates fingerprint adaptation to ensure adaptability across organs, datasets, and imaging modalities. We evaluated nnQC on seven organs using twelve publicly available datasets. Our results demonstrate that nnQC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all experiments, including cases where segmentation masks are highly degraded or completely missing, confirming its versatility and effectiveness across different organs.

TL;DR: SAT3D是一个轻量级3D体积基础模型，专门用于医学影像中的肿瘤分割，通过不确定性感知训练和对抗学习解决医学影像中组织异质性、伪影和低对比度边界等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如Segment Anything Model）直接应用于医学影像存在挑战，包括组织异质性、成像伪影和低对比度边界，特别是在肿瘤和癌症原发灶区域，导致在模糊或重叠病变区域的分割效果不佳。

Abstract: Prompt-driven vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model, have recently demonstrated remarkable adaptability in computer vision. However, their direct application to medical imaging remains challenging due to heterogeneous tissue structures, imaging artefacts, and low-contrast boundaries, particularly in tumours and cancer primaries leading to suboptimal segmentation in ambiguous or overlapping lesion regions. Here, we present Segment Any Tumour 3D (SAT3D), a lightweight volumetric foundation model designed to enable robust and generalisable tumour segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities. SAT3D integrates a shifted-window vision transformer for hierarchical volumetric representation with an uncertainty-aware training pipeline that explicitly incorporates uncertainty estimates as prompts to guide reliable boundary prediction in low-contrast regions. Adversarial learning further enhances model performance for the ambiguous pathological regions. We benchmark SAT3D against three recent vision foundation models and nnUNet across 11 publicly available datasets, encompassing 3,884 tumour and cancer cases for training and 694 cases for in-distribution evaluation. Trained on 17,075 3D volume-mask pairs across multiple modalities and cancer primaries, SAT3D demonstrates strong generalisation and robustness. To facilitate practical use and clinical translation, we developed a 3D Slicer plugin that enables interactive, prompt-driven segmentation and visualisation using the trained SAT3D model. Extensive experiments highlight its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy under challenging and out-of-distribution scenarios, underscoring its potential as a scalable foundation model for medical image analysis.

Abstract: The growing number of medical tomography examinations has necessitated the development of automated methods capable of extracting comprehensive imaging features to facilitate downstream tasks such as tumor characterization, while assisting physicians in managing their growing workload. However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.
