TL;DR: MergeDNA提出了一种分层架构，通过联合优化动态基因组标记器和潜在Transformer，结合上下文感知的预训练任务，解决了基因组序列信息密度变化和最小词汇单元定义不明确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组序列建模面临两个未解决的挑战：不同区域的信息密度差异很大，同时没有明确定义的最小词汇单元。现有方法依赖于四个原始碱基或独立设计的DNA标记器，通过简单的掩码语言建模预训练往往无法适应基因组序列的不同复杂性。

Method: 采用Token Merging技术，构建分层架构：标记化模块通过堆叠多层可微分标记合并块自动将相邻碱基分块成词，潜在编码器通过全注意力块捕获合并词的全局上下文。对称地使用潜在解码器和局部解码器，通过两个预训练任务进行学习：合并标记重建同时训练动态标记化模块并自适应过滤重要标记，自适应掩码标记建模学习预测这些过滤标记以捕获信息内容。

Result: 大量实验表明，MergeDNA在三个流行的DNA基准测试和多个多组学任务上，无论是通过微调还是零样本评估，都实现了卓越性能，超越了典型的标记化方法和大规模DNA基础模型。

Conclusion: MergeDNA通过联合优化动态标记器和上下文感知预训练任务，有效解决了基因组序列建模中的关键挑战，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Modeling genomic sequences faces two unsolved challenges: the information density varies widely across different regions, while there is no clearly defined minimum vocabulary unit. Relying on either four primitive bases or independently designed DNA tokenizers, existing approaches with naive masked language modeling pre-training often fail to adapt to the varying complexities of genomic sequences. Leveraging Token Merging techniques, this paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that jointly optimizes a dynamic genomic tokenizer and latent Transformers with context-aware pre-training tasks. As for network structures, the tokenization module automatically chunks adjacent bases into words by stacking multiple layers of the differentiable token merging blocks with local-window constraints, then a Latent Encoder captures the global context of these merged words by full-attention blocks. Symmetrically employing a Latent Decoder and a Local Decoder, MergeDNA learns with two pre-training tasks: Merged Token Reconstruction simultaneously trains the dynamic tokenization module and adaptively filters important tokens, while Adaptive Masked Token Modeling learns to predict these filtered tokens to capture informative contents. Extensive experiments show that MergeDNA achieves superior performance on three popular DNA benchmarks and several multi-omics tasks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation, outperforming typical tokenization methods and large-scale DNA foundation models.

TL;DR: CASPER是一个基于交叉注意力的框架，通过利用单细胞RNA测序的质心级表示来预测空间转录组学中未测量的基因表达，在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间转录组学平台由于实验限制和过高成本只能测量有限数量的基因，需要计算方法来预测未测量的基因表达。

Method: 提出CASPER框架，使用交叉注意力机制，整合单细胞RNA测序数据的质心级表示来预测空间转录组学中的基因表达。

Result: 在四个最先进的空间转录组学/单细胞RNA测序数据集对上进行了严格测试，CASPER在12个指标中的9个上显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作为空间转录组学到单细胞RNA测序模态转换的进一步研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics enables mapping of gene expression within its native tissue context, but current platforms measure only a limited set of genes due to experimental constraints and excessive costs. To overcome this, computational models integrate Single-Cell RNA Sequencing data with Spatial Transcriptomics to predict unmeasured genes. We propose CASPER, a cross-attention based framework that predicts unmeasured gene expression in Spatial Transcriptomics by leveraging centroid-level representations from Single-Cell RNA Sequencing. We performed rigorous testing over four state-of-the-art Spatial Transcriptomics/Single-Cell RNA Sequencing dataset pairs across four existing baseline models. CASPER shows significant improvement in nine out of the twelve metrics for our experiments. This work paves the way for further work in Spatial Transcriptomics to Single-Cell RNA Sequencing modality translation. The code for CASPER is available at https://github.com/AI4Med-Lab/CASPER.

### [3] [Leveraging NCBI Genomic Metadata for Epidemiological Insights: Example of Enterobacterales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14826)
*Bryan Harris,Majid Bani-Yaghoub*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本研究展示了如何利用NCBI数据集系统性地提取和解释传染病的时空模式，开发了开源Python包EpiNCBI_V1用于实时下载、过滤和清理病原体基因组元数据，揭示了比传统监测系统更广泛的宿主物种和更精细的时空分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCBI在流行病学方面的潜力尚未被充分探索，尽管许多研究已利用其数据进行基因组分析和基因注释，但缺乏系统性的传染病模式分析。

Method: 以肠杆菌目为案例研究，分析了超过47.7万条基因组记录和元数据，包括收集日期、地点、宿主物种和分离来源，开发了EpiNCBI_V1开源工具包进行数据处理。

Result: 与CDC的NORS系统相比，NCBI数据显示了一致的季节性高峰和食源性来源，但揭示了更广泛的宿主物种（如野生动物、环境储存库）、更大的分离株多样性和更精细的时空分辨率。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了将基因组存储库整合到公共卫生分析中的价值，以增强全球监测、疫情检测和跨物种传播追踪能力。

Abstract: Numerous studies have utilized NCBI data for genomic analysis, gene annotation, and identifying disease-associated variants, yet NCBI's epidemiological potential remains underexplored. This study demonstrates how NCBI datasets can be systematically leveraged to extract and interpret infectious disease patterns across spatial and temporal dimensions. Using Enterobacterales as a case study, we analyzed over 477,000 genomic records and metadata, including collection date, location, host species, and isolation source. We compared trends of Escherichia coli and Salmonella in NCBI data with CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). While both datasets showed consistent seasonal peaks and foodborne sources, NCBI data revealed broader host species (e.g., wildlife, environmental reservoirs), greater isolate diversity, and finer spatial-temporal resolution. These insights were enabled by our open-source Python package, EpiNCBI_V1, developed for real-time downloading, filtering, and cleaning of pathogen genomic metadata from NCBI. This work highlights the value of integrating genomic repositories into public health analytics to enhance surveillance, outbreak detection, and cross-species transmission tracking globally.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本研究使用人工智能方法分析光谱转换薄膜对作物产量的影响，通过数据增强和多种机器学习模型，实现了91.4%的分类准确率预测光谱转换薄膜是否显著影响产量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光谱转换薄膜在温室中的应用对作物生长反应存在物种差异，仅考虑单一作物属性难以理解光质调整与作物生长性能的关系，需要综合考虑多种植物表型性状和生理响应。

Method: 2021-2024年间在覆盖PEF或SF的温室中种植多种作物，测量叶片反射率、叶质量面积比、叶绿素含量、日光照积分和光饱和点等指标，使用变分自编码器进行数据增强，训练逻辑回归、决策树、随机森林、XGBoost和前馈神经网络等模型进行二元分类。

Result: 收集210个数据点，光谱转换薄膜下大多数作物产量平均增加22.5%，前馈神经网络在测试集上达到91.4%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究通过改进预测太阳光谱转换效应的能力，为叶片表型和光合特性、环境条件与太阳光谱组分之间的复杂相互作用提供了见解。

Abstract: The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.

Abstract: Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.
