We present SCR-MF, a modular two-stage workflow that combines principled dropout detection using scRecover with robust non-parametric imputation via missForest. Across public and simulated datasets, SCR-MF achieves robust and interpretable performance comparable to or exceeding existing imputation methods in most cases, while preserving biological fidelity and transparency. Runtime analysis demonstrates that SCR-MF provides a competitive balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for mid-scale single-cell datasets."}
