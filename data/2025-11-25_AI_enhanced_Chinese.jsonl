Here we introduce TeamPath, an AI system powered by reinforcement learning and router-enhanced solutions based on large-scale histopathology multimodal datasets, to work as a virtual assistant for expert-level disease diagnosis, patch-level information summarization, and cross-modality generation to integrate transcriptomic information for the clinical usage. We also collaborate with pathologists from Yale School of Medicine to demonstrate that TeamPath can assist them in working more efficiently by identifying and correcting expert conclusions and reasoning paths.

It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration.

Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling.\n  Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines.

The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff08MSA\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06BWT\u6761\u76ee\u4e0eMSA\u5217\u5bf9\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5339\u914d\u6620\u5c04\u5230MSA\u5217\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5339\u914d\u62a5\u544a\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5230\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eBWT\u7684\u6cdb\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7d22\u5f15\u4f1a\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u5e94\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u56e0\u5ea7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002MSA\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u76f8\u4f3c\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7ec4\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06BWT\u6761\u76ee\u4e0eMSA\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u6309\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5c06BWT\u5339\u914d\u6620\u5c04\u5230MSA\u5217\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5339\u914d\u6620\u5c04\u5230MSA\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5230\u6307\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eBWT\u7684\u6cdb\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6bd4\u5bf9\u5668\u6240\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eMSA\u7684BWT\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5339\u914d\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5230\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals.

ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAGL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u3002\u4f7f\u7528DkGSB\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u56e0\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66(ST)\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u89c2\u6d4b\u75c5\u7406\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u5355\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u4e25\u91cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f4e\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8868\u8fbe\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u5b66\u4e60(AGL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5f00\u53d1DkGSB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u57fa\u56e0\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u677e\u5f1b\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684top-k\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7eb3\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u56e0\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u8868\u8fbe\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cDkGSB\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals.

Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Genie-CAT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u91d1\u5c5e\u86cb\u767d\uff08\u5982\u94c1\u6c27\u8fd8\u86cb\u767d\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u673a\u68b0\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u56db\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u732e\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u9759\u7535\u52bf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\uff0cGenie-CAT\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86[Fe-S]\u7c07\u9644\u8fd1\u5f71\u54cd\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u6b8b\u57fa\u6c34\u5e73\u4fee\u9970\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u5f25\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u3002"}}

However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.\n  Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.\n  We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u914d\u6811\u6846\u67b6\u7684MILP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u822c\u6709\u73af\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfDAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5343\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe(DAGs)\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6709\u73af\u56fe\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e3aDAG\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u822c\u6709\u73af\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u652f\u914d\u6811\u6982\u5ff5\u627e\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e8f\u5217\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u89e3\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u4e24\u4e2a\u652f\u914d\u6811\u7684\u516c\u5171\u53f6\u5b50\u627e\u5230\u6240\u6709\u6700\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u52a0\u901fMILP\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec6\u83cc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe\u5343\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u539f\u672c\u8d85\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u572830\u79d2\u5185\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u914d\u6811\u7684MILP\u7b80\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u7ec4\u88c5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.\n  We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.\n  Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency.

This study focuses on the optimization of DLD design parameters, such as row shift fraction, post size, and gap distance, to enhance the selective isolation of lung cancer cells based on their physical properties. To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design. Beyond trajectory prediction, the models aid in isolating critical design variables, offering a systematic, data-driven framework for automated DLD optimization.

A recursive algorithm was designed to annotate the branches by the common taxonomic lineage of its descendants in a rooted tree. For an unrooted tree, it determines the root that best conforms to the taxonomic system based on the aforementioned lineage annotations. Based on the lineage annotations of notes, CLTree infers the monophyly of taxonomic units and quantifies the concordance between the phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic system base on Shannon entropy. The core algorithm of CLTree is highly efficient with linear complexity, capable of processing phylogenetic trees with 17,955 terminal nodes within one second.

We propose a neural network architecture incorporating Fourier Transform analysis to process trajectory data, achieving dual objectives: eliminating high-frequency noise while preserving biologically critical slow conformational dynamics, and establishing an isotropic representation space through the last hidden layer for enhanced dynamical quantification. Comparative protein simulations demonstrate our approach generates more uniform feature distributions than linear regression methods, evidenced by smoother state similarity matrices and clearer classification boundaries. Moreover, by using saliency score, we identified key structural determinants linked to effective energy landscapes governing system dynamics.

However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRIDENT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea7\u8054\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u8c31\u6765\u5408\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\uff08\u5982\u6270\u52a8\u2192RNA\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u2192\u5f62\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4eceRNA\u5230\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6784\u5efaAI\u865a\u62df\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTRIDENT\u7ea7\u8054\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMorphoGene\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b98\u79cd\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684L1000\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u548cCell Painting\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RNA\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "result": "TRIDENT\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe7\u500d\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RNA\u5f15\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5e94\u8868\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4-\u8868\u578b\u7ec4\u6620\u5c04\uff0cTRIDENT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u865a\u62df\u7ec6\u80de\u3002"}}
