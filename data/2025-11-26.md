Method: ReMAC是ReMasker的扩展，专门设计用于处理高维数据在完整和不完整情况下的分类任务。

Result: 在真实临床数据上的评估显示，与竞争分类方法相比，ReMAC在斯皮茨样肿瘤分层中实现了强大且稳健的性能。

Conclusion: ReMAC能够有效处理DNA甲基化数据中的缺失值问题，在斯皮茨样肿瘤诊断中表现出优越性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of spitzoid tumors (ST) is critical to ensure a favorable prognosis and to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Epigenetic data, particularly DNA methylation, provide a valuable source of information for this task. However, prior studies assume complete data, an unrealistic setting as methylation profiles frequently contain missing entries due to limited coverage and experimental artifacts. Our work challenges these favorable scenarios and introduces ReMAC, an extension of ReMasker designed to tackle classification tasks on high-dimensional data under complete and incomplete regimes. Evaluation on real clinical data demonstrates that ReMAC achieves strong and robust performance compared to competing classification methods in the stratification of ST. Code is available: https://github.com/roshni-mahtani/ReMAC.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 对神经退行性疾病体液生物标志物检测中分析平行性的系统评价显示，部分平行性现象罕见且报告不一致，需要更透明的稀释方案报告和标准化验证指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物标志物在神经退行性疾病诊断和监测中至关重要，但检测方法的有效性依赖于生物样本与标准曲线之间的平行性验证，不足的平行性可能导致浓度估计偏差。

Method: 按照PRISMA指南进行的系统评价，纳入2010年12月至2024年7月发表的研究，无语言限制，评估神经退行性疾病体液生物标志物检测中的分析平行性证据。

Result: 部分平行性在大多数神经退行性疾病生物标志物检测中罕见且报告不一致，狭窄的稀释范围和可变的方法学限制了结果的普适性。

Conclusion: 需要透明报告稀释方案并遵守已建立的分析验证指南，这对临床试验设计、监管审批流程和基于生物标志物的诊断可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Biomarkers are critical tools in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. Reliable quantification depends on assay validity, especially the demonstration of parallelism between diluted biological samples and the assay's standard curve. Inadequate parallelism can lead to biased concentration estimates, jeopardizing both clinical and research applications. Here we systematically review the evidence of analytical parallelism in body fluid (serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid) biomarker assays for neurodegeneration and evaluate the extent, reproducibility, and reporting quality of partial parallelism.
  This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024568766) and conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We included studies published between December 2010 to July 2024 without language restrictions. ...
  In conclusion, partial parallelism was infrequently observed and inconsistently reported in most biomarker assays for neurodegeneration. Narrow dilution ranges and variable methodologies limit generalizability. Transparent reporting of dilution protocols and adherence to established analytical validation guidelines is needed. This systematic review has practical implications for clinical trial design, regulatory approval processes, and the reliability of biomarker-based diagnostics.

Abstract: In recent years there has been a paradigm shift from the study of local task-related activation to the organization and functioning of large-scale functional and structural brain networks. However, a long-standing challenge in this large-scale brain network analysis is how to compare network organizations irrespective of their complexity. The maximum spanning tree (MST) has served as a simple, unbiased, standardized representation of complex brain networks and effectively addressed this long-standing challenge. This tree representation, however, has been limited to individual networks. Group-level trees are always constructed from the average network or through a bootstrap procedure. Constructing the group-level tree from the average network introduces bias from individual subjects with outlying connectivities. The bootstrap method can be computationally prohibitive if a good approximation is desired. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral representation of trees using the spanning tree basis. This spectral representation enables us to compute the average MST and demonstrate that this average tree captures the global properties of all the MSTs in the group and also overlaps with the union of the shortest paths in the functional brain networks.

Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) results from an impact or concussion to the head with the injury being specifically characterized through pathological degradation at various biological length scales. Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions. This framework is an attempt to quantify secondary injury and thus assist in developing targeted TBI treatments.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个深度学习模型，用于提高未萌出上颌尖牙嵌塞预测的扇区分类系统的可重复性。研究发现3扇区系统具有最高的可重复性，而DenseNet121模型在分类未萌出尖牙位置方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扇区分类系统在评估未萌出上颌尖牙位置时存在操作者间和操作者内可重复性差的问题，需要开发更可靠的方法来提高诊断一致性。

Method: 三名正畸医生和三名全科牙医使用三种扇区分类系统（5、4、3扇区）对306张X光片进行评估，四周后重复评估。同时使用在1,222张X光片上预训练的不同AI模型进行测试，寻找最佳性能模型。

Result: 3扇区系统具有最高的可重复性（Cohen's K值0.80-0.92），总体一致性为0.85。DenseNet121模型在三个不同类别中分配嵌塞尖牙表现最佳，总体准确率为76.8%。教育背景不影响观察者间或观察者内一致性。

Conclusion: AI模型可以设计用于自动分类未萌出上颌尖牙的位置，为临床诊断提供更一致和可靠的工具。

Abstract: Objectives. The aim of the present study was to develop a fully deep learning model to reduce the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction. Methods. Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p>0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion. AI models can be designed to automatically classify the position of unerupted maxillary canines.
