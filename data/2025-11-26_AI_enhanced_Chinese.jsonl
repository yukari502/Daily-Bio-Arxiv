Epigenetic data, particularly DNA methylation, provide a valuable source of information for this task.

Our work challenges these favorable scenarios and introduces ReMAC, an extension of ReMasker designed to tackle classification tasks on high-dimensional data under complete and incomplete regimes.

However, a long-standing challenge in this large-scale brain network analysis is how to compare network organizations irrespective of their complexity. The maximum spanning tree (MST) has served as a simple, unbiased, standardized representation of complex brain networks and effectively addressed this long-standing challenge. This tree representation, however, has been limited to individual networks. Group-level trees are always constructed from the average network or through a bootstrap procedure. Constructing the group-level tree from the average network introduces bias from individual subjects with outlying connectivities. The bootstrap method can be computationally prohibitive if a good approximation is desired. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral representation of trees using the spanning tree basis.

Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions.

The aim of the present study was to develop a fully deep learning model to reduce the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction. Methods. Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p>0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion. AI models can be designed to automatically classify the position of unerupted maxillary canines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u672a\u840c\u51fa\u4e0a\u988c\u5c16\u7259\u5d4c\u585e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6247\u533a\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b03\u6247\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u800cDenseNet121\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u672a\u840c\u51fa\u5c16\u7259\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6247\u533a\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u672a\u840c\u51fa\u4e0a\u988c\u5c16\u7259\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u95f4\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u5185\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u540d\u6b63\u7578\u533b\u751f\u548c\u4e09\u540d\u5168\u79d1\u7259\u533b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6247\u533a\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff085\u30014\u30013\u6247\u533a\uff09\u5bf9306\u5f20X\u5149\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56db\u5468\u540e\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u57281,222\u5f20X\u5149\u7247\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0d\u540cAI\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "3\u6247\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff08Cohen's K\u503c0.80-0.92\uff09\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e3a0.85\u3002DenseNet121\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u5d4c\u585e\u5c16\u7259\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a76.8%\u3002\u6559\u80b2\u80cc\u666f\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u95f4\u6216\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5185\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u672a\u840c\u51fa\u4e0a\u988c\u5c16\u7259\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
