### [1] [Predicting COVID-19 Prevalence Using Wastewater RNA Surveillance: A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach with Temporal Feature Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00100)
*Yifei Chen,Eric Liang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出基于废水监测数据和混杂因素的深度神经网络模型，用于估算COVID-19每日病例数，解决训练数据在不同时间段可靠性不同的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着COVID-19转变为地方性流行病，需要非侵入性方法持续监测其流行情况。废水监测提供了一种有效的监测手段，但需要建立与病例数的准确关联模型。

Method: 使用深度神经网络学习COVID-19每日病例数与废水病毒RNA浓度之间的非线性关系。基于Jiang等人(2024)的研究，利用疫情早期测试数据和废水监测数据训练模型，特别关注处理不同时间段数据可靠性的挑战。

Result: 论文提出了一个能够从废水监测数据估算COVID-19病例数的神经网络估计器，该模型能够处理时间特征可靠性变化的问题。

Conclusion: 基于废水监测的深度神经网络方法为COVID-19流行监测提供了一种有效的非侵入性工具，特别是在处理数据可靠性随时间变化的情况下具有实用价值。

Abstract: As COVID-19 transitions into an endemic disease that remains constantly present in the population at a stable level, monitoring its prevalence without invasive measures becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present a deep neural network estimator for the COVID-19 daily case count based on wastewater surveillance data and other confounding factors. This work builds upon the study by Jiang, Kolozsvary, and Li (2024), which connects the COVID-19 case counts with testing data collected early in the pandemic. Using the COVID-19 testing data and the wastewater surveillance data during the period when both data were highly reliable, one can train an artificial neural network that learns the nonlinear relation between the COVID-19 daily case count and the wastewater viral RNA concentration. From a machine learning perspective, the main challenge lies in addressing temporal feature reliability, as the training data has different reliability over different time periods.

### [2] [RadDiff: Retrieval-Augmented Denoising Diffusion for Protein Inverse Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00126)
*Jin Han,Tianfan Fu,Wu-Jun Li*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: RadDiff：一种基于检索增强去噪扩散的蛋白质逆折叠方法，通过检索结构相似蛋白构建进化信息先验，显著提升序列恢复率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质逆折叠方法要么不利用外部知识，要么依赖蛋白质语言模型。前者忽略了蛋白质数据库中的进化信息，后者参数效率低且难以适应不断增长的蛋白质数据。需要克服这些缺点。

Method: RadDiff使用分层搜索策略从大型蛋白质数据库中高效检索结构相似的蛋白质，将检索到的结构残基对残基对齐到目标结构，构建位置特异性氨基酸谱作为进化信息先验，通过轻量级集成模块有效整合该先验条件到去噪过程中。

Result: 在CATH、PDB和TS50数据集上的实验结果表明，RadDiff始终优于现有方法，序列恢复率提高高达19%，能生成高度可折叠的序列，并能有效随数据库规模扩展。

Conclusion: RadDiff通过检索增强方法有效整合了进化信息先验，为蛋白质逆折叠提供了一种参数高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了序列设计性能。

Abstract: Protein inverse folding, the design of an amino acid sequence based on a target 3D structure, is a fundamental problem of computational protein engineering. Existing methods either generate sequences without leveraging external knowledge or relying on protein language models (PLMs). The former omits the evolutionary information stored in protein databases, while the latter is parameter-inefficient and inflexible to adapt to ever-growing protein data. To overcome the above drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel method, called retrieval-augmented denoising diffusion (RadDiff), for protein inverse folding. Given the target protein backbone, RadDiff uses a hierarchical search strategy to efficiently retrieve structurally similar proteins from large protein databases. The retrieved structures are then aligned residue-by-residue to the target to construct a position-specific amino acid profile, which serves as an evolutionary-informed prior that conditions the denoising process. A lightweight integration module is further designed to incorporate this prior effectively. Experimental results on the CATH, PDB, and TS50 datasets show that RadDiff consistently outperforms existing methods, improving sequence recovery rate by up to 19%. Experimental results also demonstrate that RadDiff generates highly foldable sequences and scales effectively with database size.

### [3] [HyperADRs: A Hierarchical Hypergraph Framework for Drug-Gene-ADR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00137)
*Ze Cai,Haotian Tang,Shuai Gao,Binbin Zhou,Junhan Zhao,Jun Wen*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: HyperADRs是一个分层超图框架，用于预测药物-基因-ADR三元组水平的药物不良反应风险，通过整合多源知识图谱和对比学习实现可转移的生物机制表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的方法通常将ADR预测为药物或药物对的属性，这使得因果基因隐含，限制了其在药物基因组学决策中的价值。需要一种能够明确药物、基因和ADR之间三元关系的方法。

Method: 构建药物-基因-ADR三元组，整合来自PharmGKB和DrugBank的精准医学知识图谱。使用UniMol、ESM2、SapBERT等预训练模型嵌入药物、基因和ADR概念，通过超图卷积网络传播。采用基于FiLM的查询条件对比学习模块学习上下文特定表示，并提出九类ADR宏观系统方案以提高鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: 在PharmGKB的药物、基因和ADR留出评估中，HyperADRs在基于排名的指标上匹配或超过强基线。在PharmGKB训练并在未见过的DrugBank三元组上测试时，HyperADRs保持其排名优势，表明学习到的表征捕获了可转移的生物机制。

Conclusion: HyperADRs框架能够预测药物-基因-ADR三元组水平的ADR风险，学习到的表征具有可转移性，能够支持基于机制的药物基因组学假设生成，为精准医疗决策提供更细粒度的工具。

Abstract: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major barrier to safe and effective pharmacotherapy and increasingly reflect higher order interactions between drugs, genetic background, and clinical phenotypes. Existing graph based approaches usually predict ADRs as properties of drugs or drug pairs, leaving the causal gene implicit and limiting their value for pharmacogenomic decision making. We introduce HyperADRs, a hierarchical hypergraph framework that predicts ADR risk at the level of drug-gene-ADR triads. Starting from curated pharmacogenomic annotations in PharmGKB and the pharmacogenomics subdatabase of DrugBank, we construct high confidence triplets and integrate them with auxiliary molecular, functional, and disease relations from precision-medicine-oriented knowledge graphs. Drugs, genes, and ADR concepts are embedded with modality appropriate pretrained models (UniMol, ESM2, SapBERT) and propagated through a hypergraph convolutional network. A FiLM based, query conditioned contrastive learning module learns context specific representations so that, given any two entities, the model retrieves the correct third entity against many candidates. To improve robustness and interpretability, we propose a nine category ADR macro system scheme that reduces large heterogeneous "other" bins while aligning with organ system reasoning in clinical pharmacology. Across drug-, gene-, and ADR-held-out evaluations on PharmGKB, HyperADRs matches or exceeds strong baselines on ranking based metrics. When trained on PharmGKB and tested on unseen DrugBank triplets, HyperADRs maintains its ranking advantage, indicating that the learned representations capture transferable biological mechanisms and can support mechanistically grounded pharmacogenomic hypothesis generation.

### [4] [Layer Probing Improves Kinase Functional Prediction with Protein Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00376)
*Ajit Kumar,IndraPrakash Jha*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 研究发现ESM-2蛋白语言模型的中后层（20-33层）比最终层在激酶功能预测中表现更好，通过系统性的层间分析提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白语言模型应用大多只使用最终层嵌入，可能忽略了早期层编码的生物学有意义信息。需要系统评估不同层在功能预测中的表现差异。

Method: 系统评估ESM-2所有33层在激酶功能预测中的表现，使用无监督聚类和有监督分类方法，结合领域级提取、校准概率估计和可复现的基准测试流程。

Result: 中后层transformer层（20-33层）在无监督调整兰德指数上比最终层提升32%，在有监督同源感知准确率达到75.7%。

Conclusion: transformer深度包含功能上不同的生物学信号，有原则的层选择能显著改善激酶功能预测，不应仅依赖最终层嵌入。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have transformed sequence-based protein analysis, yet most applications rely only on final-layer embeddings, which may overlook biologically meaningful information encoded in earlier layers. We systematically evaluate all 33 layers of ESM-2 for kinase functional prediction using both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. We show that mid-to-late transformer layers (layers 20-33) outperform the final layer by 32 percent in unsupervised Adjusted Rand Index and improve homology-aware supervised accuracy to 75.7 percent. Domain-level extraction, calibrated probability estimates, and a reproducible benchmarking pipeline further strengthen reliability. Our results demonstrate that transformer depth contains functionally distinct biological signals and that principled layer selection significantly improves kinase function prediction.

### [5] [Tissue stress measurements with Bayesian Inversion Stress Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00550)
*L. Anger,A. Schoenit,F. Wodrascka,C. Rossé,R. M. Mège,B. Ladoux,P. Marcq*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: BISM是一种基于贝叶斯反演的压力显微镜技术，通过测量细胞产生的牵引力来量化组织内部应力，无需假设细胞流变学特性，适用于各种边界条件和细胞类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解机械力在基本生物过程中的作用至关重要，如形态发生、集体迁移、细胞分裂和死亡等。测量组织内部应力对于研究这些过程具有重要意义。

Method: 贝叶斯反演应力显微镜（BISM）技术，通过测量体外细胞生成的牵引力来反推组织内部应力。该方法不依赖细胞流变学假设，适用于任意形状的受限组织和不同细胞类型的单层。

Result: BISM在各种实验设置中表现出适用性和鲁棒性，包括不同边界条件、任意形状的受限组织以及不同细胞类型的单层。与其它常见应力测量技术相比，在一致的实验设置下进行了对比验证。

Conclusion: BISM是一种有效的组织内部应力测量方法，适用于复杂异质性组织，但存在局限性，需要进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: Cells within biological tissue are constantly subjected to dynamic mechanical forces. Measuring the internal stress of tissues has proven crucial for our understanding of the role of mechanical forces in fundamental biological processes like morphogenesis, collective migration, cell division or cell elimination and death. Previously, we have introduced Bayesian Inversion Stress Microscopy (BISM), which is relying on measuring cell-generated traction forces in vitro and has proven particularly useful to measure absolute stresses in confined cell monolayers. We further demonstrate the applicability and robustness of BISM across various experimental settings with different boundary conditions, ranging from confined tissues of arbitrary shape to monolayers composed of different cell types. Importantly, BISM does not require assumptions on cell rheology. Therefore, it can be applied to complex heterogeneous tissues consisting of different cell types, as long as they can be grown on a flat substrate. Finally, we compare BISM to other common stress measurement techniques using a coherent experimental setup, followed by a discussion on its limitations and further perspectives.

### [6] [Disentangling Proxies of Demographic Adjustments in Clinical Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00905)
*Aashna P. Shah,James A. Diao,Emma Pierson,Chirag J. Patel,Arjun K. Manrai*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: ARC框架通过识别人口统计学调整的替代因素（如坐高），开发了更精确的肺功能测试参考方程，超越了种族中性方程和种族分层模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床方程中使用粗略的人口统计学调整（特别是种族调整）受到越来越多批评，但当前去除种族的方法未能解决观察到的差异的根本原因。需要一种框架来识别群体层面差异的解释因素，以开发更准确、精确的临床方程。

Method: 提出ARC框架（识别人口统计学调整替代因素的方法），应用于两个观察性队列（CDC NHANES和UK Biobank，共159,893名参与者）的肺活量测试。分析横断面社会人口学或暴露测量是否能解释种族群体间的肺功能差异，特别关注坐高等生理因素。

Result: 横断面社会人口学或暴露测量未能解释种族群体间的肺功能差异，但坐高解释了健康黑人和白人成年人之间剩余肺容量差异的26%。基于此开发了ARC_PFT方程，包含坐高和腰围，在UK Biobank黑人参与者中平均绝对误差降低13%，在NHANES中降低24%。与种族分层模型相比，在亚洲和西班牙裔人群中的域转移脆弱性更低，平均绝对误差分别降低19.3%和35.6%。

Conclusion: ARC框架提供了一种理解不精确人口统计学调整替代因素的方法，并开发了个性化临床方程。通过识别坐高等生理因素，可以超越种族中性方程和种族分层模型的性能，同时减少域转移脆弱性。

Abstract: The use of coarse demographic adjustments in clinical equations has been increasingly scrutinized. In particular, adjustments for race have sparked significant debate with several medical professional societies recommending race-neutral equations in recent years. However, current approaches to remove race from clinical equations do not address the underlying causes of observed differences. Here, we present ARC (Approach for identifying pRoxies of demographic Correction), a framework to identify explanatory factors of group-level differences, which may inform the development of more accurate and precise clinical equations. We apply ARC to spirometry tests across two observational cohorts, CDC NHANES and UK Biobank, comprising 159,893 participants. Cross-sectional sociodemographic or exposure measures did not explain differences in reference lung function across race groups beyond those already explained by age, sex, and height. By contrast, sitting height accounted for up to 26% of the remaining differences in lung volumes between healthy Black and White adults. We then demonstrate how pulmonary function test (PFT) reference equations can incorporate these factors in a new set of equations called $ARC_{PFT}$, surpassing the predictive performance of the race-neutral GLI-Global equation recommended by major pulmonary societies. When compared to GLI-Global, inclusion of sitting height and waist circumference in $ARC_{PFT}$ decreased mean absolute error by 13% among Black participants in the UK Biobank and by 24% in NHANES. $ARC_{PFT}$ also had reduced vulnerability to domain shift compared to race-based methods, with mean absolute error 19.3% and 35.6% lower than race-stratified models in out-of-sample Asian and Hispanic populations, respectively. This approach provides a path for understanding the proxies of imprecise demographic adjustments and developing personalized clinical equations.

### [7] [Sleep Apnea Detection on a Wireless Multimodal Wearable Device Without Oxygen Flow Using a Mamba-based Deep Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00989)
*Dominik Luszczynski,Richard Fei Yin,Nicholas Afonin,Andrew S. P. Lim*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 基于Mamba架构的深度学习模型使用ANNE One可穿戴设备数据准确诊断睡眠呼吸障碍，与PSG结果高度相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种基于可穿戴设备数据的深度学习模型，用于睡眠呼吸障碍的诊断和事件级特征分析，以替代传统的多导睡眠图（PSG）检查

Method: 使用384名成人的PSG和ANNE One可穿戴设备同步记录数据，基于ECG信号自动对齐，采用Mamba架构的深度序列神经网络进行训练和评估

Result: 模型预测的AHI与PSG标签高度相关（R=0.95），在AHI>5阈值下灵敏度0.96、特异度0.87，在30秒时段级别灵敏度0.93、特异度0.95

Conclusion: Mamba深度学习模型结合ANNE One可穿戴设备数据能准确预测AHI、识别睡眠呼吸障碍，在临床相关阈值下表现良好，并能进行事件级生理特征分析

Abstract: Objectives: We present and evaluate a Mamba-based deep-learning model for diagnosis and event-level characterization of sleep disordered breathing based on signals from the ANNE One, a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography, triaxial accelerometry, chest and finger temperature, and finger phototplethysmography.
  Methods: We obtained concurrent PSG and wearable sensor recordings from 384 adults attending a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture.
  Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event.
  Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.

### [8] [Personalized optimization of pediatric HD-tDCS for dose consistency and target engagement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01406)
*Zeming Liu,Mo Wang,Xuanye Pan,Yuan Yang,Wilson Truccolo,Quanying Liu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于儿童发育解剖的个性化HD-tDCS剂量优化框架，解决了传统统一方案在儿童中因头部发育差异导致的电场强度年龄依赖性和性别差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童HD-tDCS剂量目前主要依赖"一刀切"方案，但儿童头部解剖和组织特性在快速发育过程中变化显著，这些变化会强烈影响电流如何到达发育中的大脑，因此需要开发考虑发育解剖的个性化剂量方案。

Method: 使用70个儿童头部模型和常用皮层靶点进行前向模拟，发现标准方案存在年龄依赖性电场强度降低和系统性性别差异。为此开发了双目标优化框架，生成个性化Pareto前沿来平衡电场强度和聚焦性，并提出了剂量一致性策略和目标参与策略两种实用处方。

Result: 标准方案导致靶点电场强度随年龄显著降低，并存在性别差异。优化框架能生成个性化Pareto前沿，两种策略均对电导率变化保持稳健。组织电导率敏感性具有深度依赖性，稀疏HD-tDCS方案在目标参与策略下能达到与密集方案相同的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一个基于发育解剖和生理不确定性的原则性框架，为儿童HD-tDCS规划提供了可靠且个性化的神经调控剂量方法，解决了传统方案的局限性。

Abstract: High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) dosing in children remains largely empirical, relying on one-size-fits-all protocols despite rapid developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties that strongly modulate how currents reach the developing brain. Using 70 pediatric head models and commonly used cortical targets, our forward simulations find that standard montages produce marked age-dependent reductions in target electric-field intensity and systematic sex differences linked to tissue-volume covariation, underscoring the profound limitations of conventional uniform montages. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a developmentally informed, dual-objective optimization framework designed to generate personalized Pareto fronts summarizing the trade-off between electric-field intensity and focality. From these optimized solutions, we derive two practical dosing prescriptions: a dose-consistency strategy that, for the first time, enforces fixed target intensity across individuals to implicitly mitigate demographic effects, and a target-engagement strategy that maximizes target intensity under safety limits. Both strategies remain robust to large conductivity variations, and we further show that dense HD-tDCS solutions admit sparse equivalents without performance loss under the target-engagement strategy. We also find that tissue conductivity sensitivity is depth-dependent, with Pareto-front distributions for superficial cortical targets most influenced by gray matter, scalp, and bone conductivities, and those for a deep target predominantly shaped by gray and white matter conductivities. Together, these results establish a principled framework for pediatric HD-tDCS planning that explicitly accounts for developmental anatomy and physiological uncertainty, enabling reliable and individualized neuromodulation dosing in pediatric populations.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于深度学习的三轴加速度计睡眠-觉醒检测模型，在多种设备和不同年龄、睡眠障碍人群中表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手腕加速度计在睡眠-觉醒状态推断中存在唤醒检测效果差、跨设备泛化能力不足、缺乏不同年龄范围和睡眠障碍人群验证的问题。

Method: 收集453名成年人的手腕加速度计与多导睡眠图同步数据，使用三种设备。提取30秒时段的特征，训练三分类模型（觉醒、睡眠、带唤醒的睡眠），然后通过决策树合并为觉醒vs睡眠。为提高唤醒检测，专门在睡眠效率低和/或唤醒指数高的受试者上训练。

Result: 模型表现出高性能：F1分数0.86，睡眠敏感性0.87，觉醒特异性0.78，与多导睡眠图在总睡眠时间（R=0.69）和睡眠效率（R=0.63）上有显著中度相关。模型对睡眠障碍（包括睡眠呼吸暂停和周期性肢体运动）具有鲁棒性，在三种加速度计设备上表现一致。

Conclusion: 提出了一个从活动记录仪检测睡眠-觉醒的深度模型，对睡眠障碍存在具有相对鲁棒性，并在多种常用手腕加速度计设备上具有泛化能力。

Abstract: Study Objectives: Wrist accelerometry is widely used for inferring sleep-wake state. Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.

### [10] [Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00696)
*Hasi Hays,Yue Yu,William Richardson*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: 提出分层分子语言模型（HMLMs），将细胞信号网络建模为分子语言，使用图结构注意力机制处理网络拓扑，在时间信号预测上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数学和统计方法难以捕捉细胞信号网络中的上下文依赖性信号传导、通路串扰和多尺度时间动态。需要新的AI方法来更好地建模细胞内通信的复杂性。

Method: 提出分层分子语言模型（HMLMs），将分子视为标记，蛋白质相互作用、翻译后修饰和调控事件作为语义关系，采用图结构注意力机制适应信号网络拓扑，通过分层注意力模式整合分子、通路和细胞尺度的信息。

Result: 在包含100多种分子的心脏成纤维细胞信号网络上，HMLM在时间信号预测上取得MSE=0.058，比图神经网络（0.083）提升30%，比常微分方程模型（0.121）提升52%。在稀疏时间采样条件下（仅4个时间点）仍保持MSE=0.041。

Conclusion: HMLMs为AI驱动的生物学和医学提供了基础，通过AI驱动的分子语言表示将分子机制与细胞表型连接起来，为系统生物学提供了强大范式，推动了精准医学应用和AI时代的治疗发现。

Abstract: Cellular signaling networks represent complex information processing systems that have been modeled via traditional mathematical or statistical approaches. However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICVision是一个首创的AI系统，通过视觉和语言推理模拟专家级EEG ICA成分分类，直接解读ICA仪表板可视化，超越传统基于手工特征的分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG ICA成分分类器（如ICLabel）依赖手工特征，而ICVision旨在模拟神经学家通过视觉检查EEG成分的方式，实现AI代理的视觉认知在神经生理学中的首次科学应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（GPT-4 Vision）直接解读ICA仪表板可视化（地形图、时间序列、功率谱、ERP图），将每个成分分类为六种标准类别（大脑、眼睛、心脏、肌肉、通道噪声、其他噪声），并提供置信度和类人解释。

Result: 在124个EEG数据集的3,168个ICA成分上评估，ICVision与专家共识的一致性达到κ=0.677，超越了MNE ICLabel，同时在模糊情况下保留了临床相关的大脑信号。超过97%的输出被专家评为可解释和可操作的。

Conclusion: ICVision标志着科学AI的范式转变，模型不仅能分类，还能看、推理和沟通，为全球可扩展、可解释和可复现的EEG工作流程打开了大门，标志着AI代理在脑科学等领域实现专家级视觉决策能力的出现。

Abstract: We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.

Abstract: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms. The code is available at https://github.com/bozeklab/TransientTrack.

TL;DR: 提出两种控制基因电路中图灵图案形成的机制：图案开关和图案调节器，通过分析网络规模揭示控制性与鲁棒性的权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成生物系统中空间图案控制面临参数鲁棒性差和实验可调性有限的挑战，需要开发系统性的图案控制方法

Method: 引入图案开关（通过单一参数控制图案启动）和图案调节器（使用弱非线性振幅方程在不同图案类型间转换）两种互补机制，分析网络规模对控制性和鲁棒性的影响

Result: 发现网络规模存在关键权衡：小网络易于控制但鲁棒性差，大网络鲁棒性增强但可调性降低，存在同时满足可进化性和可设计性的最佳平衡点

Conclusion: 为在生命系统中设计可编程图案提供了实用的设计规则，实现了对图灵图案形成的系统性控制

Abstract: Controlling spatial patterns in synthetic biological systems remains challenging due to poor parameter robustness and limited experimental tunability. We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability. Our results offer practical design rules for engineering programmable patterns in living systems.

Abstract: Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks.

Motivation: 现有生物基础模型直接采用通用机器学习架构，未考虑生物数据的独特物理化学和结构特性，导致性能不佳，无法有效捕捉生物数据的长程依赖、稀疏信息和复杂"语法"。

Method: 使用神经架构搜索(NAS)系统探索架构设计空间，评估多模态生物数据，分析架构、分词和训练策略的相互作用，发现高性能架构并提炼设计原则，提出架构预测方法为新任务推荐最优架构。

Conclusion: BioArc为创建下一代任务特定和基础生物模型提供了基础资源和原则性方法论，推动生物基础模型从直觉驱动向系统化设计转变。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.

TL;DR: Rep3Net是一个统一深度学习架构，结合分子描述符、图表示和SMILES嵌入来预测药物生物活性，在PARP-1数据集上表现优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QSAR模型依赖分子描述符，难以捕捉化合物的结构和上下文信息，导致生物活性预测效果有限。需要开发能整合多种信息源的新方法。

Method: 提出Rep3Net统一深度学习架构，整合三种特征：1) 分子描述符数据；2) 基于图表示的化合物空间和关系信息；3) 通过ChemBERTa从SMILES字符串生成的上下文嵌入。采用多模态特征拼接进行生物活性预测。

Result: 在PARP-1数据集上，Rep3Net相比传统独立模型（GCN、GAT、XGBoost等）实现了最高的预测性能，为药物发现中的化合物计算筛选提供了可扩展框架。

Conclusion: Rep3Net通过整合多模态特征有效提升了生物活性预测能力，为早期药物发现提供了更可靠的预测工具，特别适用于PARP-1等关键治疗靶点。

Abstract: In early stage drug discovery, bioactivity prediction of molecules against target proteins plays a crucial role. Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经科学领域药物研发成功率低于10%，成本高昂且失败率高，需要及时识别有前景的项目以优化资源分配和降低财务风险

Method: 使用ClinicalTrials.gov数据和临床试验结果数据集，采用统计NLP技术提取文本特征，构建非LLM模型（逻辑回归、梯度提升、随机森林）和基于BioBERT的LLM模型进行概率预测

Result: 在1976-2024年101,145个临床试验的回顾性数据集上，非LLM模型ROC-AUC为0.64，BioBERT模型ROC-AUC为0.74，Brier Score为0.185，预测误差比行业基准平均减少40%，70%情况下预测优于基准

Conclusion: 将NLP驱动的洞察整合到药物开发决策中，可增强神经科学项目的战略规划和投资分配优化

Abstract: This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无监督方法分析果蝠叫声的离散性、句法和时间结构，发现冲突情境下的沟通复杂度更高，体现为更长的最大重复序列和更复杂的音节转移网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是分析分级发声系统（以果蝠为例）的沟通模式复杂度与行为情境的关系，开发无监督方法来推断叫声的离散性、句法和时间结构。

Method: 方法包括：1）通过流形学习改进音节无监督标记的基线，研究梅尔频谱图降维对标记的影响；2）将叫声编码为音节序列分析句法类型；3）提取最大重复序列评估句法结构；4）使用统计检验分析情境依赖性和复杂度。

Result: 研究发现：1）关联性句法而非组合性句法；2）音节使用具有情境依赖性；3）最大重复序列呈重尾分布（截断幂律，指数α<2），表明组合复杂度编码机制；4）母幼互动以重复为特征，冲突情境的沟通复杂度高于非对抗情境。

Conclusion: 结论是沟通复杂度在分歧情境中更高，反映了信息压缩性较低。果蝠发声系统表现出情境依赖的复杂沟通模式，特别是在冲突情境中。

Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent α < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.

TL;DR: 利用CDC废水监测数据评估11种模型对美国COVID-19疫情的周度预测性能，发现n-sub-epidemic非加权集成模型在3-4周预测期表现最佳，ARIMA和GAM在1-2周预测期表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确可靠的预测模型对指导公共卫生应对和疫情政策决策至关重要。回顾性评估模型性能对于改进流行病预测能力是必要的，特别是利用废水监测数据这一新兴数据源。

Method: 使用CDC国家废水监测系统的COVID-19废水数据，从2022年3月至2024年9月对美国全国和四大区域进行133周连续回顾性预测。评估了11种模型，包括ARIMA、GAM、简单线性回归、Prophet和n-sub-epidemic框架（最优模型、加权集成和非加权集成变体）。使用MAE、MSE、WIS和95%预测区间覆盖率评估性能。

Result: n-sub-epidemic非加权集成模型在3-4周预测期表现最佳，特别是在全国层面以及中西部和西部地区。ARIMA和GAM在1-2周预测期在大多数区域表现最好。Prophet和简单线性回归在所有区域和预测期表现均较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了区域特异性建模策略的价值，并证明了n-sub-epidemic框架在利用废水监测数据进行实时疫情预测中的实用性。不同预测期需要不同的最优模型选择。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable forecasting models are critical for guiding public health responses and policy decisions during pandemics such as COVID-19. Retrospective evaluation of model performance is essential for improving epidemic forecasting capabilities. In this study, we used COVID-19 wastewater data from CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System to generate sequential weekly retrospective forecasts for the United States from March 2022 through September 2024, both at the national level and for four major regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We produced 133 weekly forecasts using 11 models, including ARIMA, generalized additive models (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), Prophet, and the n-sub-epidemic framework (top-ranked, weighted-ensemble, and unweighted-ensemble variants). Forecast performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), weighted interval score (WIS), and 95% prediction interval coverage. The n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles outperformed all other models at 3-4-week horizons, particularly at the national level and in the Midwest and West. ARIMA and GAM performed best at 1-2-week horizons in most regions, whereas Prophet and SLR consistently underperformed across regions and horizons. These findings highlight the value of region-specific modeling strategies and demonstrate the utility of the n-sub-epidemic framework for real-time outbreak forecasting using wastewater surveillance data.
