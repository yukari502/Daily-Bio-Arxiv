However, publicly releasing GWAS summary statistics poses well-recognized privacy risks, including the potential to infer an individual's participation in the study or to reveal sensitive phenotypic information (e.g., disease status). While differential privacy (DP) offers a rigorous mathematical framework for mitigating these risks, existing DP techniques for GWAS either introduce excessive noise or restrict the release to a limited set of results. In this work, we present practical DP mechanisms for releasing the complete set of genome-wide association statistics with privacy guarantees. We demonstrate the accuracy of the privacy-preserving statistics released by our mechanisms on a range of GWAS datasets from the UK Biobank, utilizing both real and simulated phenotypes. We introduce two key techniques to overcome the limitations of prior approaches: (1) an optimization-based randomization mechanism that directly minimizes the expected error in GWAS results to enhance utility, and (2) the use of personalized priors, derived from predictive models privately trained on a subset of the dataset, to enable sample-specific optimization which further reduces the amount of noise introduced by DP. Overall, our work provides practical tools for accurately releasing comprehensive GWAS results with provable protection of study participants."}

Current farming practices typically rear crickets in mixed-sex populations without automated sex sorting, despite potential benefits such as selective breeding, optimized reproduction ratios, and nutritional differentiation. This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm. The model reached a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.977 during testing, and real-world experiments with groups of crickets achieved an overall sorting accuracy of 86.8%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained devices for insect farming applications, offering a practical solution to improve efficiency and sustainability in cricket production."}

Assembling the haplotypes of polyploid genomes remains a significant challenge due to the exponential search space of haplotype phasings and read assignment ambiguity; the latter challenge is particularly difficult for polyploid haplotype assemblers since the information contained within the observed sequence reads is often insufficient for unambiguous haplotype assignment in polyploid genomes. We present pHapCompass, probabilistic haplotype assembly algorithms for diploid and polyploid genomes that explicitly model and propagate read assignment ambiguity to compute a distribution over polyploid haplotype phasings. We develop graph theoretic algorithms to enable statistical inference and uncertainty quantification despite an exponential space of possible phasings. Since prior work evaluates polyploid haplotype assembly on synthetic genomes that do not reflect the realistic genomic complexity of polyploidy organisms, we develop a computational workflow for simulating genomes and DNA-seq for auto- and allopolyploids. Additionally, we generalize the vector error rate and minimum error correction evaluation criteria for partially phased haplotypes. Benchmarking of pHapCompass and several existing polyploid haplotype assemblers shows that pHapCompass yields competitive performance across varying genomic complexities and polyploid structures while retaining an accurate quantification of phase uncertainty. The source code for pHapCompass, simulation scripts, and datasets are freely available at https://github.com/bayesomicslab/pHapCompass."}
