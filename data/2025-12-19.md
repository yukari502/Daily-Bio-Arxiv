Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are driving a prominent shift in artificial intelligence across different domains, including biomedical imaging. These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise.

### [2] [Accessibility of Modified NK Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15828)
*Henry Nunns,Manda Riehl*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了两种改进的NK适应度景观模型：θNK和HNK，分别引入局部相关性参数θ和基因调控掩蔽机制H，通过模拟分析发现这些改进能增强景观的可达性，表明崎岖性不一定阻碍进化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NK模型在模拟生物进化时存在局限性，需要更贴近生物现实的改进。θNK模型旨在整合局部相关性，模拟更真实的适应度效应；HNK模型则引入基因调控效应，模拟基因调控网络的影响而不需完整建模网络结构。

Method: 提出了两种改进模型：1) θNK模型引入参数θ整合局部Rough Mount Fuji型相关性；2) HNK模型引入掩蔽机制，让某些位点调控其他位点的表达。通过广泛的参数模拟（N, K, θ, H），分析这些改进对景观可达性和局部最优数量的影响，并考察不同交互模式（blocked, adjacent, random）的效果。

Result: 增加θ或掩蔽位点数量H通常能增强可达性，即使在有许多局部最优的景观中也是如此，表明崎岖性不一定阻碍进化路径。不同的交互模式导致可达性和最优结构的不同观察结果。

Conclusion: 虽然比传统NK模型更复杂，但θNK和HNK模型各自提供了新的生物学相关维度，为理解遗传和调控结构如何影响种群的进化潜力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we present two modifications of traditional $NK$ fitness landscapes, the $θNK$ and $HNK$ models, and explore these modifications via accessibility and ruggedness. The $θNK$ model introduces a parameter $θ$ to integrate local Rough Mount Fuji-type correlations in subgenotype contributions, simulating more biologically realistic correlated fitness effects. The $HNK$ model incorporates gene regulation effects by introducing a masking mechanism where certain loci modulate the expression of other loci, simulating effects observed in gene regulatory networks without modeling the full network. Through extensive simulations across a wide range of parameters ($N$, $K$, $θ$, and $H$), we analyze the impact of these modifications on landscape accessibility and the number of local optima. We find that increasing $θ$ or the number of masking loci ($H$) generally enhances accessibility, even in landscapes with many local optima, showing that ruggedness doesn't necessarily hinder evolutionary pathways. Additionally, distinct interaction patterns (blocked, adjacent, random) lead to different observations in accessibility and optimum structure. While more complex than traditional $NK$, we believe each model provides a new biologically relevant facet to fitness landscapes and provides insight into how genetic and regulatory structures influence the evolutionary potential of populations.

### [3] [Handling Class Imbalance Problem in Skin Lesion Classification: Finding Strengths and Weaknesses of Various Balancing Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15837)
*Ariful Islam Khandaker,Abdullah Al Shafi,Mohiuddin Ahmad*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该论文综述了使用ISIC 2016数据集解决皮肤病变分类中类别不平衡问题的方法，包括欠采样、过采样和混合方法，发现混合方法如SMOTE+TL能提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病变自动分类对早期诊断很重要，但数据集存在类别不平衡问题（恶性病例样本少），这影响了深度学习模型的性能和泛化能力。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2，结合多种平衡方法：欠采样、过采样（SMOTE、ADASYN）和混合方法（Tomek Links、SMOTE+TL）。

Result: 过采样方法能提升性能但可能导致过拟合；混合方法如SMOTE+TL通过去除噪声或边界样本，增强了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 选择合适的平衡方法对构建稳健、敏感的医疗图像诊断系统至关重要，混合方法在解决类别不平衡问题上表现更优。

Abstract: Automatic skin lesion classification from dermoscopy images is important for the early diagnosis of skin diseases such as melanoma. Class imbalance in skin lesion datasets, notably the defects in the representation of malignant(cancerous) cases, is one of the difficulties for deep learning models' performances and generalizations. This paper offers an exhaustive review of some of the balancing methods that aim to address class imbalances using the example of the ISIC 2016 dataset. A light-weight CNN model, MobileNetV2, was combined with under-sampling, over-sampling, and hybrid balancing methods such as Tomek Links(TL), SMOTE, and SMOTE with TL. Over-sampling methods like SMOTE and ADASYN improve performance but may lead to overfitting due to redundant synthetic samples. Hybrid methods like SMOTE+TL counter this drawback by removing noisy or boundary samples so that model generalization is enhanced. Thus, this analysis stresses the need to choose the right balancing methods for robust and sensitive diagnostic systems in medical image processing.

TL;DR: 开发了StructBioReasoner多智能体系统，用于设计靶向内在无序蛋白的生物制剂，通过竞赛式推理框架生成高亲和力结合物，在Der f 21和NMNAT-2上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内在无序蛋白（IDPs）是重要的治疗靶点，约80%癌症相关蛋白含有长无序区域，但缺乏稳定结构使其"不可成药"。现有计算方法如扩散模型可设计高亲和力IDP结合物，但需要自主系统在复杂构象集合中进行推理并协调多种计算工具。

Method: 设计了StructBioReasoner可扩展多智能体系统，采用新颖的竞赛式推理框架，专门化智能体竞争生成和优化治疗假设。智能体整合领域知识，访问文献合成、AI结构预测、分子模拟和稳定性分析，通过可扩展的联邦智能体中间件Academy在HPC基础设施上协调执行。

Result: 在Der f 21和NMNAT-2上进行了基准测试：对于Der f 21，787个设计和验证的候选物中超过50%在结合自由能方面优于文献中人工设计的参考结合物；对于更具挑战性的NMNAT-2，从97,066个结合物中识别出三种结合模式，包括已知的NMNAT2:p53界面。

Conclusion: StructBioReasoner为在Exascale平台上开发IDP治疗发现的智能体推理系统奠定了基础，展示了多智能体系统在复杂生物制剂设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent crucial therapeutic targets due to their significant role in disease -- approximately 80\% of cancer-related proteins contain long disordered regions -- but their lack of stable secondary/tertiary structures makes them "undruggable". While recent computational advances, such as diffusion models, can design high-affinity IDP binders, translating these to practical drug discovery requires autonomous systems capable of reasoning across complex conformational ensembles and orchestrating diverse computational tools at scale.To address this challenge, we designed and implemented StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system for designing biologics that can be used to target IDPs. StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy. We benchmark StructBioReasoner across Der f 21 and NMNAT-2 and demonstrate that over 50\% of 787 designed and validated candidates for Der f 21 outperformed the human-designed reference binders from literature, in terms of improved binding free energy. For the more challenging NMNAT-2 protein, we identified three binding modes from 97,066 binders, including the well-studied NMNAT2:p53 interface. Thus, StructBioReasoner lays the groundwork for agentic reasoning systems for IDP therapeutic discovery on Exascale platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发纳米材料改良剂，以支持在营养有限、高胁迫的地外环境（如月球和火星）中进行可持续植物栽培，同时也能应用于地球农业。

Method: 通过电沉积法合成MgO HNTs，使用扫描电镜表征；采用响应面方法（Box-Behnken设计）评估温度、MgO HNT浓度和光照时间对番茄种子生长的影响；在地球土壤模拟物、月球和火星风化层模拟物中进行验证实验。

Result: MgO HNTs显著提高了根和茎的长度，幼苗长度和根长胁迫耐受指数是最敏感的指标。在地球土壤中，最佳条件为25°C、12小时光照、100 mg/L MgO HNTs；在月球风化层中，100 mg/L效果最佳；在火星风化层中，10 mg/L效果最佳。

Conclusion: MgO HNTs能有效增强植物在陆地和外星基质中的早期发育，展示了其作为纳米材料改良剂在地球和太空环境中可持续植物栽培的应用潜力。

Abstract: This study examines the application of metal coated nanotubes, specifically magnesium oxide coated halloysite nanotubes (MgO HNTs), to enhance seed germination and early plant development under Earth, lunar, and Martian soil conditions. MgO HNTs were synthesized through an electrodeposition process and characterized by scanning electron microscopy to confirm successful surface modification. Growth experiments using Heirloom Cherry Tomato and Golden Tomato seeds were conducted under hydroponic and soil based conditions and subsequently extended to lunar and Martian regolith simulants. A response surface methodology approach based on a Box Behnken design was used to evaluate the effects of temperature, MgO HNT concentration, and light duration on multiple growth responses. Seedling length and the root length stress tolerance index were identified as the most responsive indicators of MgO HNT treatment. Optimal conditions consisting of 25 C, 12 h light exposure, and 100 mg per L MgO HNTs produced the greatest increases in root and shoot length in Earth soil simulants. Validation experiments in extraterrestrial regolith analogs showed that MgO HNTs supported germination, root penetration, and overall seedling vigor under nutrient limited and high stress conditions. Lunar regolith exhibited maximal root development at 100 mg per L, whereas Martian regolith showed optimal growth at 10 mg per L, reflecting differences in mineral composition and oxidative characteristics. These findings demonstrate that MgO HNTs can enhance early plant development across both terrestrial and extraterrestrial substrates and support their potential use as nanomaterial based amendments for sustainable plant cultivation in Earth and space environments.
