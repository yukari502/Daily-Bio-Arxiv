TL;DR: 该论文证明了在生化反应网络中，要减少一个组分的丰度波动，必须至少有一个"牺牲"组分增加其变异性，这是细胞控制的必要代价。

Motivation: 细胞组分常以低拷贝数存在，随机生产降解事件导致显著分子丰度波动。虽然反馈控制理论上可抑制这种波动，但先前研究推测存在基本性能约束：减少一个组分的波动需要至少一个其他组分增加变异性。需要对此猜想提供严格证明。

Method: 基于分子丰度间互信息率的概率电流分解，提出了一个精确且通用的证明方法。该方法适用于任意大小的反应网络。

Result: 成功证明了在任意反应网络中，减少一个组分的丰度波动确实需要至少一个其他组分增加其变异性。这为先前猜想提供了严格的理论基础。

Conclusion: 细胞组分的变异性是细胞控制的必要条件，波动组分不一定是"噪声"源，而可能是参与去除其他组分"噪声"的控制分子。这表明细胞控制需要某些组分作为"牺牲品"来换取其他组分的稳定性。

Abstract: Many cellular components are present in such low numbers that individual stochastic production and degradation events lead to significant fluctuations in molecular abundances. Although feedback control can, in principle, suppress such low-copy-number fluctuations, general rules have emerged that suggest fundamental performance constraints on feedback control in biochemical systems. In particular, previous work has conjectured that reducing abundance fluctuations in one component requires at least one sacrificial component with increased variability in arbitrary reaction networks of any size. Here, we present an exact and general proof of this statement based on probability current decompositions of mutual information rates between molecular abundances. This suggests that variability in cellular components is necessary for cellular control and that fluctuating components do not necessarily generate cellular "noise" but may correspond to control molecules that are involved in removing "noise" from other cellular components.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AML具有极高的分子异质性和高复发率，精准医学虽然引入了突变特异性疗法，但许多患者仍缺乏有效的个性化治疗选择

Method: 1) 使用WGCNA从TCGA-LAML队列的RNA测序数据中筛选20个高价值生物标志物；2) 用AlphaFold3建模靶点结构；3) 用DOGSiteScorer引擎定量映射可成药热点；4) 开发反应优先的进化元启发式算法和多目标优化程序，从片段库组装新配体

Result: 生成的结构独特化学实体具有药物样特性（QED评分0.5-0.7），通过ADMET分析和分子对接验证，如配体L1对A08A96生物标志物的结合自由能为-6.571 kcal/mol

Conclusion: 整合系统生物学与元启发式分子组装能够产生药理学可行的患者定制先导化合物，为AML及其他疾病的精准肿瘤学提供了可扩展的蓝图

Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond
