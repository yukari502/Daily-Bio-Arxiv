  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉瓣生物力学对维持正常心脏功能至关重要，特别是二叶式主动脉瓣的病理变化会改变瓣叶负荷、增加应变并加速疾病进展。当前成像和计算方法难以捕捉快速瓣膜运动和复杂的患者特异性特征。

Method: 结合图像配准与有限元方法，利用4D经食道超声心动图和CT获取患者特异性瓣膜几何形状，在FEM中模拟主动脉瓣关闭并生成中间变形状态，通过配准算法校正模拟与图像之间的不匹配。

Result: 在20名患者中，FEM增强的配准比直接配准准确度提高40%（TEE 33%，CT 46%）。三叶瓣成人显示均匀变形，二叶瓣显示不对称应变，儿童瓣膜具有低平均面积应变但高变异性。

Conclusion: FEM增强的配准框架提高了几何追踪能力，为患者特异性主动脉瓣变形提供了临床相关见解，支持个体化干预规划。

Abstract: Aortic valve (AV) biomechanics play a critical role in maintaining normal cardiac function. Pathological variations, particularly in bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs), alter leaflet loading, increase strain, and accelerate disease progression. Accurate, patient-specific characterization of valve geometry and deformation is essential for predicting disease progression and guiding durable repair. Current imaging and computational methods often fail to capture rapid valve motion and complex patient-specific features. To address these challenges, we combined image registration with finite element method (FEM) to enhance AV tracking and biomechanical assessment. Patient-specific valve geometries from 4D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and CT were used in FEM to model AV closure and generate intermediate deformation states. The FEM-generated states facilitated leaflet tracking, while the registration algorithm corrected mismatches between simulation and image. Across 20 patients, FEM-augmented registration improved accuracy by 40% compared with direct registration (33% for TEE, 46% for CT). This improvement enabled more reliable strain estimation directly from imaging and reducing uncertainties from boundary conditions and material assumptions. Areal and Green-Lagrange strains, as well as effective strain, were quantified in adult trileaflet/bicuspid, and pediatric patients. Trileaflet adults showed uniform deformation, BAVs exhibited asymmetric strain, and pediatric valves had low mean areal strain with high variability. Convergence between trileaflet adult and pediatric valves in mean effective strain suggests volumetric deformation drives age- and size-related differences. The FEM-augmented registration framework enhances geometric tracking and provides clinically relevant insights into patient-specific AV deformation, supporting individualized intervention planning.

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯纵向混合模型分析TCR克隆动态，替代传统的Fisher精确检验，应用于前列腺癌转移定向治疗研究，发现治疗相关克隆扩增与预后相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统使用Fisher精确检验分析T细胞受体克隆动态需要患者内成对比较，存在局限性。需要更灵活的统计方法来处理可变随访时间、缺失数据，并更好地关联克隆动态与疾病状态、干预措施和预后。

Method: 开发了灵活的贝叶斯纵向混合模型，能够处理可变长度的患者随访数据和缺失值，避免因结构限制而省略数据。模型将克隆分为动态（扩增或收缩）和静态类别，并开发高维惩罚对数线性模型分析受体基序和VJ基因富集组合。

Result: 在前列腺癌转移定向治疗队列中，发现MDT患者克隆扩增显著增加，且与后续疾病进展相关（独立于MDT分层内外）。分析显示扩增克隆具有独特的生物学特征，无论是否由MDT诱导。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯纵向混合模型为TCR克隆动态分析提供了更灵活、更全面的统计框架，能够揭示治疗干预与免疫反应之间的关联，有助于理解癌症免疫反应机制和预后预测。

Abstract: Examination of T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality has become a way of understanding immunologic response to cancer and its interventions in recent years. An aspect of these analyses is determining which receptors expand or contract statistically significantly as a function of an exogenous perturbation such as therapeutic intervention. We characterize the commonly used Fisher's exact test approach for such analyses and propose an alternative formulation that does not necessitate pairwise, within-patient comparisons. We develop this flexible Bayesian longitudinal mixture model that accommodates variable length patient followup and handles missingness where present, not omitting data in estimation because of structural practicalities. Once clones are partitioned by the model into dynamic (expanding or contracting) and static categories, one can associate their counts or other characteristics with disease state, interventions, baseline biomarkers, and patient prognosis. We apply these developments to a cohort of prostate cancer patients who underwent randomized metastasis-directed therapy or not. Our analyses reveal a significant increase in clonal expansions among MDT patients and their association with later progressions both independent and within strata of MDT. Analysis of receptor motifs and VJ gene enrichment combinations using a high-dimensional penalized log-linear model we develop also suggests distinct biological characteristics of expanding clones, with and without inducement by MDT.

Method: 使用简单的现实模型和平均场模型来分析SCN中VL和DM神经元之间的耦合效应，研究分岔导致内源性模式消失的机制

Result: 发现跳跃式转变源于超临界Hopf-like分岔，表明光刺激信号的周期和强度，以及VL和DM区域细胞的相对比例对系统同步至关重要

Conclusion: SCN中神经元同步不仅取决于耦合强度，还受光信号特性和细胞区域分布比例的影响，跳跃式转变机制揭示了生物钟同步的精细调控

Abstract: The synchronization of biological activity with the alternation of day and night (circadian rhythm) is performed in the brain by a group of neurons, constituting the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is divided into two subgroups of oscillating cells: the ventro-lateral (VL) neurons, which are exposed to light (photic signal) and the dorso-medial (DM) neurons which are coupled to the VL cells. When the coupling between these neurons is strong enough, the system synchronizes with the photic period. Upon increasing the cell coupling, the entrainment of the DM cells has been recently shown to occur via a very sharp (jumping) transition when the period of the photic input is larger than the intrinsic period of the cells. Here, we characterize this transition with a simple realistic model. We show that two bifurcations possibly lead to the disappearance of the endogenous mode. Using a mean field model, we show that the jumping transition results from a supercritical Hopf-like bifurcation. This finding implies that both the period and strength of the stimulating photic signal, and the relative fraction of cells in the VL and DM compartments are crucial in determining the synchronization of the system.

Motivation: 1型糖尿病具有高度代谢异质性，传统生物标志物如糖化血红蛋白无法充分表征疾病特征，需要更全面的代谢状态评估方法。

Method: 提出可解释深度学习框架，整合连续血糖监测数据和实验室资料，使用Transformer编码器建模跨模态时间依赖关系，通过高斯混合模型识别潜在代谢表型，利用注意力可视化和SHAP特征归因实现模型可解释性。

Result: 在577名1型糖尿病患者中识别出5种潜在代谢表型，从代谢稳定到心血管代谢风险升高不等；这些表型在血糖控制、脂质代谢、肾脏标志物和促甲状腺激素水平方面表现出不同的生化特征；注意力分析显示血糖变异是主要时间因素，SHAP分析确定糖化血红蛋白、甘油三酯、胆固醇、肌酐和促甲状腺激素是表型分化的关键贡献者。

Conclusion: 该可解释多模态时间嵌入框架揭示了1型糖尿病中生理学上一致的代谢亚组，支持超越单一生物标志物的风险分层，为个性化糖尿病管理提供了新方法。

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.
