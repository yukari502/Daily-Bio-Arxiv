In copy number variant (CNV) detection from NGS, many algorithms compare read depth between test samples and a reference sample, assuming they are process-matched. When this assumption is violated, with causes ranging from reagent lot changes to multi-site processing, the reference becomes inappropriate, introducing false CNV calls or masking true pathogenic variants. Detecting such heterogeneity before downstream analysis is critical for reliable clinical interpretation. Existing batch effect detection methods either cluster samples based on raw features, risking conflation of biological signal with technical variation, or require known batch labels that are frequently unavailable. We introduce a method that addresses both limitations by clustering samples according to their Bayesian model evidence. The central insight is that evidence quantifies compatibility between data and model assumptions, technical artifacts violate assumptions and reduce evidence, whereas biological variation, including CNV status, is anticipated by the model and yields high evidence. This asymmetry provides a discriminative signal that separates batch effects from biology. We formalize heterogeneity detection as a likelihood ratio test for mixture structure in evidence space, using parametric bootstrap calibration to ensure conservative false positive rates. We validate our approach on synthetic data demonstrating proper Type I error control, three clinical targeted sequencing panels (liquid biopsy, BRCA, and thalassemia) exhibiting distinct batch effect mechanisms, and mouse electrophysiology recordings demonstrating cross-modality generalization. Our method achieves superior clustering accuracy compared to standard correlation-based and dimensionality-reduction approaches while maintaining the conservativeness required for clinical usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u6548\u5e94\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u68c0\u9a8c\u533a\u5206\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u6df7\u6dc6\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5df2\u77e5\u6279\u6b21\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u636e\u805a\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6280\u672f\u4f2a\u5f71\u8fdd\u53cd\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u800c\u751f\u7269\u53d8\u5f02\uff08\u5305\u62ecCNV\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u671f\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u4e3e\u6821\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684I\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9776\u5411\u6d4b\u5e8f\u9762\u677f\uff08\u6db2\u4f53\u6d3b\u68c0\u3001BRCA\u3001\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u8d2b\u8840\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5c0f\u9f20\u7535\u751f\u7406\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u6279\u6b21\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u6548\u5e94\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, for high-quality whole mitochondrial DNA genome sequences (mitogenomes), population data remain limited. In this paper, we offer a new method, MitoFREQ, for estimating the population frequencies of mitogenomes. MitoFREQ uses the mitogenome resources HelixMTdb and gnomAD, harbouring information from 195,983 and 56,406 mitogenomes, respectively. Neither HelixMTdb nor gnomAD can be queried directly for individual mitogenome frequencies, but offers single nucleotide variant (SNV) allele frequencies for each of 30 \"top-level\" haplogroups (TLHG). We propose using the HelixMTdb and gnomAD resources by classifying a given mitogenome within the TLHG scheme and subsequently using the frequency of its rarest SNV within that TLHG weighted by the TLHG frequency. We show that this method is guaranteed to provide a higher population frequency estimate than if a refined haplogroup and its SNV frequencies were used. Further, we show that top-level haplogrouping can be achieved by using only 227 specific positions for 99.9% of the tested mitogenomes, potentially making the method available for low-quality samples. The method was tested on two types of datasets: high-quality forensic reference datasets and a diverse collection of scrutinised mitogenomes from GenBank. This dual evaluation demonstrated that the approach is robust across both curated forensic data and broader population-level sequences. This method produced likelihood ratios in the range of 100-100,000, demonstrating its potential to strengthen the statistical evaluation of forensic mtDNA evidence.

Although deep learning has advanced automated AF diagnosis, existing approaches often struggle to exploit complementary time-frequency information effectively, limiting both robustness under intra-dataset and generalization across diverse clinical datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-modal deep learning framework comprising two key components: a Bidirectional Gating Module (BGM) and a Cross-modal Supervised Contrastive Learning (CSCL) strategy. The BGM facilitates dynamic, reciprocal refinement between time and frequency domain features, enhancing model robustness to signal variations within a dataset. Meanwhile, CSCL explicitly structures the joint embedding space by pulling together label-consistent samples and pushing apart different ones, thereby improving inter-class separability and enabling strong cross-dataset generalization. We evaluate our method through five-fold cross-validation on the AFDB and the CPSC2021 dataset, as well as bidirectional cross-dataset experiments (training on one and testing on the other). Results show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating that our approach achieves both high intra-dataset robustness and excellent cross-dataset generalization.

Numerical simulations demonstrate that this combination achieves complete tumor clearance in approximately 50 days, representing an 11\\% acceleration compared to VV monotherapy (56 days), while VSV alone fails to eradicate tumors. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical thresholds for viral burst size and B18R inhibition, while sensitivity analysis highlights infection rates and burst sizes as the most influential parameters for treatment efficacy. Temporal optimization reveals that therapeutic outcomes are maximized through immediate VSV administration followed by delayed VV injection within a 1-19 day window, offering a strategic approach to overcome the timing and dosing challenges inherent in OVT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63cf\u8ff0VSV\u548cVV\u8054\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793aVV\u611f\u67d3\u7ec6\u80de\u4ea7\u751fB18R\u86cb\u767d\u4e2d\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u7d20-\u03b1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3aVSV\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5185\u590d\u5236\u7684\"\u4e52\u4e53\"\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u5355\u836f\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u6e05\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6eb6\u7624\u75c5\u6bd2\u7597\u6cd5\uff08OVT\uff09\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fVSV\u548cVV\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u5355\u836f\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u80bf\u7624\u6e05\u9664\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u80bf\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u3001\u75c5\u6bd2\u590d\u5236\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u7d20\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u53cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u5206\u5c94\u5206\u6790\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u5728\u7ea650\u5929\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u80bf\u7624\u6e05\u9664\uff0c\u6bd4VV\u5355\u836f\u6cbb\u7597\uff0856\u5929\uff09\u52a0\u901f11%\uff0cVSV\u5355\u836f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u9664\u80bf\u7624\u3002\u5206\u5c94\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u75c5\u6bd2\u7206\u53d1\u89c4\u6a21\u548cB18R\u6291\u5236\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u611f\u67d3\u7387\u548c\u7206\u53d1\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u7597\u6548\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "VSV\u548cVV\u7ec4\u5408\u901a\u8fc7\"\u4e52\u4e53\"\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6e05\u9664\u80bf\u7624\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u7acb\u5373\u7ed9\u4e88VSV\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57281-19\u5929\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ed9\u4e88VV\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u514b\u670dOVT\u7684\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u5242\u91cf\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.\n  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bHuSHeM\u4e0eWHO(+SIRI)\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u7537\u6027\u751f\u80b2\u529b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u53d7\u5230\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bHuSHeM\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7cbe\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eWHO\u6807\u51c6\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u708e\u75c7\u53cd\u5e94\u6307\u6570(SIRI)\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5WHO(+SIRI)\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u4e34\u5e8a\u961f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "HuSHeM\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684AUC\u503c\uff0c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u66f4\u7a84\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff08\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u9762\u79ef\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u9608\u503c\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u51c0\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u708e\u75c7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u5b50\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u80b2\u7b5b\u67e5\u548c\u8f6c\u8bca\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u65e8\u5728\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e34\u5e8a\u5224\u65ad\u6216\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}
