Motivation: 抑郁症是常见的精神健康障碍，传统诊断方法依赖主观自我报告，缺乏可靠性，需要客观准确的抑郁症状态识别技术。EEG信号能捕捉大脑活动且不受外部行为因素影响，可揭示与抑郁症相关的神经变化。

Method: 提出深度学习框架，结合卷积神经网络(CNN)和门控循环单元(GRU)从EEG记录中联合提取空间和时间特征，然后应用最小冗余最大相关性(MRMR)算法选择最具信息量的特征，最后使用全连接神经网络进行分类。

Result: 提出的模型在准确识别抑郁状态方面表现优异，总体准确率达到98.74%。通过有效整合时空信息并采用优化的特征选择，该方法显示出作为临床应用的可靠工具的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能实现抑郁症的准确早期检测，还有潜力支持改进的治疗策略和患者预后，为抑郁症诊断提供了客观、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates the detection and classification of depressive and non-depressive states using deep learning approaches. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.

Motivation: 预测非小细胞肺癌患者的总生存期对临床决策和药物开发至关重要。虽然肿瘤和血液标志物的动力学本质相关，但它们的联合动态及其与总生存期的关系尚不清楚。

Method: 开发了一个机制模型（TALN-k），通过耦合微分方程捕捉肿瘤负荷与三种关键血液标志物（白蛋白、乳酸脱氢酶、中性粒细胞）动力学之间的相互作用。该模型通过机器学习框架（TALN-kML）增强用于总生存期预测。使用非线性混合效应模型估计参数，并在接受atezolizumab单药治疗（862例）或联合治疗（1115例）的非小细胞肺癌患者的临床试验数据上进行训练和验证。

Result: TALN-k成功描述了个体和群体水平的标志物动力学，揭示了肿瘤与血液标志物之间的复杂相互作用，在修正BIC和对数似然指标上显著优于先前的最优经验模型。TALN-kML模型在总生存期预测方面优于非耦合的经验模型，C指数（0.74±0.02 vs 0.72±0.03）、12个月AUC（0.83±0.004 vs 0.79±0.05）和准确率（0.77±0.03 vs 0.76±0.05）均有改善。

Conclusion: 这种机制学习方法提供了一个可解释的模型，通过联合整合肿瘤和血液标志物动力学，改善了非小细胞肺癌纵向数据描述和生存预测。该方法为个性化治疗策略和药物开发优化提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Background Predicting overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential for clinical decision-making and drug development. While tumor and blood test markers kinetics are intrinsically linked, their joint dynamics and relationship to OS remain unknown. Methods We developed a mechanistic model capturing the interplay between tumor (T) burden and three key blood markers kinetics: albumin (A), lactate dehydrogenase (L), and neutrophils (N), through coupled differential equations (termed TALN-k). This model was enhanced with a machine learning framework (TALN-kML) for OS prediction. The model was trained and validated on clinical trial data from NSCLC patients treated with atezolizumab in monotherapy (N = 862 patients) or combination therapy (N = 1,115). Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling, and survival predictions were assessed using individual and trial level metrics. Results TALN-k successfully described individual and population-level marker kinetics, revealing complex interactions between tumor and blood markers, and improving corrected BIC and log-likelihood metrics by a significant margin of previous empirical state-of-the-art models. Feature selection methods also highlighted valuable predictive parameters, indicatives of good or poor prognosis. The TALN-kML model outperformed empirical, uncoupled models, achieving improved C-index (0.74 $\pm$ 0.02 vs 0.72 $\pm$ 0.03), 12-months AUC (0.83 $\pm$ 0.004 vs 0.79 $\pm$ 0.05), and accuracy (0.77 $\pm$ 0.03 vs 0.76 $\pm$ 0.05) in OS prediction. Conclusion Our mechanistic learning approach allows for an interpretable model, which improves on longitudinal data description and on survival prediction in NSCLC by jointly integrating tumor and blood markers kinetics. This methodology offers a promising avenue for both personalized treatment strategies and drug development optimization.
