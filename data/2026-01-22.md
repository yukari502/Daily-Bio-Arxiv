Abstract: The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to an explosive increase in biological sequence data, making sequence clustering a fundamental task in large-scale bioinformatics analyses. Unlike traditional clustering problems, biological sequence clustering faces unique challenges due to the lack of direct similarity measures, strict biological constraints, and demanding requirements for both scalability and accuracy. Over the past decades, a wide variety of methods have been developed, differing in how they model sequence similarity, construct clusters, and prioritize optimization objectives. In this review, we provide a comprehensive methodological overview of biological sequence clustering algorithms. We begin by summarizing the main strategies for modeling sequence similarity, which can be divided into three stages: sequence encoding, feature generation, and similarity measurement. Next, we discuss the major clustering paradigms, including greedy incremental, hierarchical, graph-based, model-based, partitional, and deep learning approaches, highlighting their methodological characteristics and practical trade-offs. We then discuss clustering objectives from three key perspectives: scalability and resource efficiency, biological interpretability, and robustness and clustering quality. Organizing existing methods along these dimensions allows us to explore the trade-offs in biological sequence clustering and clarify the contexts in which different approaches are most appropriate. Finally, we identify current limitations and challenges, providing guidance for researchers and directions for future method development.

### [2] [Robust Machine Learning for Regulatory Sequence Modeling under Biological and Technical Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14969)
*Yiyao Yang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 研究基因组学机器学习在生物和技术分布偏移下的鲁棒性，发现现有模型在i.i.d.假设下表现良好，但在真实生物分布偏移下性能下降，提出结合模拟基准和真实数据分析的鲁棒性框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度卷积和注意力模型在DNA调控序列预测任务中表现出色，但通常基于i.i.d.假设评估，而实际应用涉及细胞类型特异性程序、进化更替、实验协议变化和测序伪影等分布偏移，需要评估模型在真实生物环境下的鲁棒性

Method: 提出结合机制模拟基准和真实数据分析的鲁棒性框架：1) 模拟基准生成包含细胞类型特异性程序、PWM扰动、GC偏倚、深度变化、批次效应和异方差噪声的调控输出；2) 在MPRA数据集上进行真实数据分析；3) 评估CNN、BiLSTM和Transformer模型；4) 添加生物结构先验（模拟中的motif特征和MPRA中的全局GC含量）

Result: 模型在轻度GC含量偏移下保持准确和合理校准，但在motif效应重连和噪声主导机制下表现出更高误差、严重方差失校准和覆盖崩溃；添加生物结构先验改善了分布内误差并在有意义的基因组偏移下提供一致的鲁棒性增益，但对强实验噪声保护有限；不确定性感知的选择性预测可恢复低风险子集

Conclusion: 标准i.i.d.评估无法揭示的鲁棒性差距在生物分布偏移下显现，添加生物结构先验和不确定性感知预测可提高模型鲁棒性，为基因组学机器学习在真实生物环境中的应用提供重要见解

Abstract: Robust machine learning for regulatory genomics is studied under biologically and technically induced distribution shifts. Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise. Uncertainty-aware selective prediction offers an additional safety layer that risk coverage analyses on simulated and MPRA data show that filtering low confidence inputs recovers low risk subsets, including under GC-based out-of-distribution conditions, although reliability gains diminish when noise dominates.

*Santiago Silva,Ghiles Reguig,Neil P Oxtoby,Andre Altmann,Marco Lorenzi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Fed-ComBat：一种用于去中心化数据批效应协调的联邦学习框架，在线性和非线性情况下都能达到与集中式方法相当的效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多中心分析需要足够样本量和代表性临床人群，但传统协调方法需要数据集中化，存在患者隐私泄露风险和数据治理问题

Method: 提出Fed-ComBat联邦学习框架，在去中心化数据上实现批效应协调，保留非线性协变量效应，无需数据集中化或先验参数假设

Result: 在模拟数据和7个神经影像研究（包括健康对照和多种疾病患者）上验证，联邦学习设置下Fed-ComBat在线性和非线性情况下均与集中式方法效果相当

Conclusion: Fed-ComBat提供了一种安全有效的联邦批效应协调方法，解决了多中心分析中的数据隐私和治理问题，同时保持与集中式方法相当的协调效果

Abstract: The use of multi-centric analyses is crucial for obtaining sufficient sample sizes and representative clinical populations in experimental studies. In this setting, data harmonization techniques are typically employed to address systematic biases and ensure the interoperability of the data. State-of-the-art harmonisation approaches are based on the statistical theory of random effect modeling, allowing to account for either linear of non-linear biases and batch effects. However, optimizing these statistical methods generally requires data centralization at some point during the analysis pipeline, therefore introducing the risk of exposing individual patient information while posing significant data governance issues. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we present Fed-ComBat, a federated framework for batch effect harmonization on decentralized data. Fed-ComBat enables the preservation of nonlinear covariate effects without requiring centralization of data and without prior parametric hypothesis on the variables to account for. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Fed-ComBat against a comprehensive panel of existing approaches based on the state-of-the-art ComBat, along with distributed and nonlinear variants. Our experiments are based on extensive simulated data, and on the analysis of multiple cohorts based on 7 neuroimaging studies comprising healthy controls (CI) and subjects with various disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our results show that in a federated settings, Fed-ComBat harmonization exhibits comparable results to centralized methods for both linear and nonlinear cases. On real data, harmonized trajectories of the thickness ofthe right hippocampus across lifespan measured on a set of 7 public studies show comparable results between centralized and federated models and are consistent with the literature when using a nonlinear model. The code is publicly available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/greguig/fedcombat

### [4] [FBApro: A fast, simple linear transformation for diverse metabolic modeling tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14577)

Result: 在合成和实验数据集上验证，方法计算高效，无需细胞目标函数，易于实现。成功应用于通量数据去噪、插补，以及从更易获取的数据类型预测稳态通量。

Conclusion: FBApro为代谢建模提供了简单通用的优化替代方案，通过正交投影强制执行稳态约束，适用于多种代谢数据分析任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Constraint-based metabolic modeling is the predominant framework for simulating cellular metabolism. The central assumption of these models is that metabolism operates at a steady state, meaning that the production and consumption rates of each metabolite are balanced. This assumption imposes linear constraints on the fluxes of biochemical reactions. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), a fundamental method in the field, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing a cellular objective (e.g., growth) over the resulting linear subspace of steady state fluxes. Many other methods in the field are expressed either as a modification to FBA, or use FBA as a black box within an algorithm. Here, we propose a simple and general alternative to optimization that, for any flux vector, finds the closest flux distribution within the steady-state subspace. This operation corresponds to an orthogonal projection that enforces the steady-state assumption. We further introduce extensions to handle cases involving unknown or fixed fluxes through modified projections and tailored affine subspaces. The overall approach is computationally efficient, does not require a cellular objective, and is easy to implement. We validate our method and its variants on both synthetic and experimental datasets, demonstrating their speed and utility for denoising and imputing metabolic flux data, and for predicting steady-state fluxes from more readily available types of data.
  Code availability: The code implementing FBApro is available at https://github.com/Singh-Lab/FBApro. All code required to reproduce the figures in the paper is available, although the data used must be sourced separately. The repository also contains toy models and examples.

Abstract: The fundamental understanding of how cells physically interact with each other and their environment is key to understanding their organisation in living tissues. Over the past decades several computational methods have been developed to decipher emergent multi-cellular behaviors. In particular agent-based (or cell-based) models that consider the individual cell as basic modeling unit tracked in space and time enjoy increasing interest across scientific communities. In this article we explore a particular class of cell-based models, so-called Deformable Cell Models (DCMs), that allow to simulate the biophysics of the cell with high realism. After situating this model among other model types, We give an overview of past and recent DCM developments and discuss new simulation results of several applications covering in-vitro and in-vivo systems. Our goal is to demonstrate how such models can generate quantitative added value in biological and biotechnological problems.

TL;DR: engGNN提出了一种双图神经网络框架，结合外部生物网络和数据驱动生成的图，用于高维组学数据的疾病分类和生物标志物发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组学数据（转录组、蛋白质组、代谢组）具有高维度、小样本和复杂生物网络的特点，现有方法通常只依赖外部知识图谱或数据驱动生成的单一图谱，无法充分利用互补信息。

Method: engGNN采用双图框架：1）从已知网络数据库构建生物信息无向特征图；2）从树集成模型生成数据驱动的有向特征图。通过联合利用这两种图生成更全面的嵌入表示。

Result: 在模拟实验和真实基因表达数据应用中，engGNN持续优于现有最先进方法。除了分类性能提升，还能提供可解释的特征重要性评分，支持通路富集分析等生物学发现。

Conclusion: engGNN是一个稳健、灵活且可解释的框架，适用于高维组学数据的疾病分类和生物标志物发现，能够整合外部知识和数据驱动信息，提高预测性能和生物学解释性。

Abstract: Omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.

Abstract: Missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful biological insights. However, existing imputation approaches, which often assume uniformity and data completeness, struggle to address cases with large patches of missing data. In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets. This work introduces a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in both biological and clinical data analysis. Our code is available at Anomalous Github.
