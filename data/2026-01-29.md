Conclusion: 该方法能够量化免疫扰动后T细胞丰度的克隆特异性动态变化，为研究T细胞免疫应答提供新工具

Abstract: Each T cell typically carries a specific T-cell receptor (TCR) that determines its specificity against an epitope presented by the HLA complex on a target cell. Antigenic challenge triggers the expansion of reactive cells within a diverse pool of T cells with randomly generated receptors, a process that results in epitope-driven shifts of TCR frequencies over time. Here, we analyze the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on the TCR populations in peripheral blood drawn from seven COVID-naive individuals, before vaccines were widely available. To identify SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TCR sequences among the $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ TCR sequences sampled before and after vaccination, we develop statistical criteria to detect significant increases in abundance of positive TCR clones. Application of our statistical methods shows a robust identification of TCR sequences that respond to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in vivo, illustrating the feasibility of quantifying the clone-specific dynamics of T-cell abundance changes following immunological perturbations.

TL;DR: 电压成像显微镜中扫描与宽场显微镜在不同信噪比和采样条件下的电压尖峰检测性能比较分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电压成像显微镜已成为研究神经活动的重要工具，但不同成像方法（点扫描、线扫描、宽场）的时域采样方式对信号保真度的影响尚未充分研究，需要分析这些采样方法的优缺点及其对电压尖峰检测保真度的影响。

Method: 基于分析建模和计算机模拟的数学框架，采用蒙特卡洛方法进行仿真分析。

Result: 扫描显微镜在低信噪比条件和只需检测少量尖峰时表现更优；宽场显微镜在时间欠采样和需要检测大量尖峰时表现更优；两种模式在采样率增加且帧率达到电压指示剂衰减速率时性能趋于一致。

Conclusion: 为电压成像的时域采样参数选择提供指导，特别建议不要在低于500 Hz的帧率下使用扫描电压成像显微镜。

Abstract: Significance: Voltage imaging microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate neural activity both in vivo and in vitro. Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz.
