We propose Gengram, a conditional memory module that introduces an explicit and highly efficient lookup primitive for multi-base motifs via a genomic-specific hashing scheme, establishing genomic \"syntax\". Integrated into the backbone of state-of-the-art GFMs, Gengram achieves substantial gains (up to 14%) across several functional genomics tasks. The module demonstrates robust architectural generalization, while further inspection of Gengram's latent space reveals the emergence of meaningful representations that align closely with fundamental biological knowledge. By establishing structured motif memory as a modeling primitive, Gengram simultaneously boosts empirical performance and mechanistic interpretability, providing a scalable and biology-aligned pathway for the next generation of GFMs. The code is available at https://github.com/zhejianglab/Genos, and the model checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/ZhejiangLab/Gengram.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gengram\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u78b1\u57fa\u57fa\u5e8f\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u627e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\"\u8bed\u6cd5\"\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u751f\u7269\u57fa\u5e8f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u5e8f\u67e5\u627e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGengram\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u65b9\u6848\u5efa\u7acb\u663e\u5f0f\u67e5\u627e\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u627e\u591a\u78b1\u57fa\u57fa\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe14%\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u57fa\u5e8f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u539f\u8bed\uff0cGengram\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent advances in epistatic inference, exemplified by Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) (Zeng et al., Phys. Rev. E, 2022), have generated numerous Circos plots illustrating genetic inter-dependencies. In this study, we constructed a dataset of 1,984 Circos plots and developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to classify and identify the corresponding genomic variants.

Stochastic logistic models (SLMs), which treat species as independent -- akin to ideal gases in physics -- and incorporate environmental noise, reproduce many single-species patterns but cannot account for the pairwise covariation observed in microbiome data. Here we introduce an interacting stochastic logistic model (ISLM) that minimally extends the SLM by sampling an ensemble of random interaction networks chosen to preserve these single-species laws. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we map the model's phase diagram -- stable, chaotic, and unbounded-growth regimes -- where the transition from stable fixed-point to chaos is controlled by network sparsity and interaction heterogeneity via a May-like instability line. Going beyond mean-field theory to account for finite communities, we derive an estimator of an effective stability parameter that quantifies distance to the edge of instability and can be inferred from the width of the distribution of pairwise covariances in empirical species-abundance data. Applying this framework to synthetic data, environmental microbiomes, and human gut cohorts indicates that these communities tend to operate near the edge of instability. Moreover, gut communities from healthy individuals cluster closer to this edge and exhibit broader, more heterogeneous associations, whereas dysbiosis-associated states shift toward more stable regimes -- enabling discrimination across conditions such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer. Together, our results connect macroecological laws, interaction-network ensembles, and May's stability theory, suggesting that complex communities may benefit from operating near a dynamical phase transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u968f\u673a\u903b\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\uff08ISLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7fa4\u843d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fb9\u7f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u903b\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u5355\u7269\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u534f\u53d8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u5b8f\u89c2\u751f\u6001\u89c4\u5f8b\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u968f\u673a\u903b\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\uff08ISLM\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u7ed8\u5236\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u80a0\u9053\u961f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7fa4\u843d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u7f18\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u5065\u5eb7\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u80a0\u9053\u7fa4\u843d\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6001\u5931\u8c03\u72b6\u6001\u5219\u5411\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u5b8f\u89c2\u751f\u6001\u89c4\u5f8b\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u5408\u548cMay\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u590d\u6742\u7fa4\u843d\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The database contains over 1000 curated models and an even larger number of non-curated models. All the models are stored in the machine-readable format, SBML. Although SBML can be translated into the human readable Antimony format, analyzing the models can still be time consuming. In order to bridge this gap, a LLM (large language model) assistant was created to analyze the BioModels and allow interaction between the user and the model using natural language. By doing so, a user can easily and rapidly extract the salient points in a given model. Our analysis workflow involved 'chunking' BioModels and converting them to plain text using llama3, and then embedding them in a ChromaDB database.

One important area of application is leukaemia research, where leukaemia cells are genetically modified in preclinical studies to explore new therapeutic targets for reducing leukaemic burden. In advanced experiments, these studies are often conducted in mice and generate time-resolved data, the analysis of which may reveal growth-inhibiting effects of the investigated gene modifications. However, the experimental data is often times evaluated using statistical tests which compare measurements from only two different time points. This approach does not only reduce the time series to two instances but also neglects biological knowledge about cell mechanisms. Such knowledge, translated into mathematical models, expands the power to investigate and understand effects of modifications on underlying mechanisms based on experimental data. We utilise two population growth models -- an exponential and a logistic growth model -- to capture cell dynamics over the whole experimental time horizon and to consider all measurement times jointly. This approach enables us to derive modification effects from estimated model parameters. We demonstrate that the exponential growth model recognises simulated scenarios more reliably than the other candidate model and than a statistical test. Moreover, we apply the population growth models to evaluate the efficacy of candidate gene knockouts in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukaemia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7ec6\u80de\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u70b9\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u56e0\u4fee\u9970\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u88ab\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd9\u65e2\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\u53c8\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u957f\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u589e\u957f\u4e24\u79cd\u79cd\u7fa4\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6355\u83b7\u7ec6\u80de\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fee\u9970\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u903b\u8f91\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6025\u6027\u767d\u8840\u75c5PDX\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5019\u9009\u57fa\u56e0\u6572\u9664\u7684\u7597\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u4fee\u9970\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks.
