TL;DR: AFD-Instruction是首个针对抗体的大规模指令数据集，包含抗体理解和抗体设计两个组件，通过指令微调提升LLMs在抗体相关任务上的性能

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在蛋白质表示学习方面取得了显著进展，但它们在通过自然语言解释和设计抗体方面的能力仍然有限，需要专门的数据集来填补这一空白

Method: 构建AFD-Instruction数据集，包含两个关键组件：1) 抗体理解（从序列推断功能属性），2) 抗体设计（在功能约束下进行从头序列生成），提供明确的序列-功能对齐，支持基于自然语言指令的抗体设计

Result: 在通用大语言模型上进行广泛的指令微调实验表明，AFD-Instruction在多种抗体相关任务上持续提升性能表现

Conclusion: AFD-Instruction通过将抗体序列与功能文本描述联系起来，为推进抗体建模和加速治疗发现建立了新的基础

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced protein representation learning. However, their capacity to interpret and design antibodies through natural language remains limited. To address this challenge, we present AFD-Instruction, the first large-scale instruction dataset with functional annotations tailored to antibodies. This dataset encompasses two key components: antibody understanding, which infers functional attributes directly from sequences, and antibody design, which enables de novo sequence generation under functional constraints. These components provide explicit sequence-function alignment and support antibody design guided by natural language instructions. Extensive instruction-tuning experiments on general-purpose LLMs demonstrate that AFD-Instruction consistently improves performance across diverse antibody-related tasks. By linking antibody sequences with textual descriptions of function, AFD-Instruction establishes a new foundation for advancing antibody modeling and accelerating therapeutic discovery.

### [2] [Learning virulence-transmission relationships using causal inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05196)

TL;DR: LETR框架通过Granger因果分析学习病原体毒力与传播间的动态关系，发现两者关系高度依赖情境而非固定不变


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型假设病原体特征间存在静态固定关系，但实际中这些关系可能是动态变化的，需要数据驱动的方法来揭示其因果机制

Method: 提出LETR框架，整合Granger因果分析、生成映射和转移算子分析，将短期可预测性与长期特征分布联系起来

Result: 在合成数据中准确恢复已知因果方向；在COVID-19数据中发现毒力驱动传播而非相反，且长期趋势指向低毒力低传播的双模态分布

Conclusion: 病原体毒力与传播关系高度情境依赖，挑战了简化模型，为复杂生物系统的机制性特征关联分析提供了通用框架

Abstract: The relationship between traits that influence pathogen virulence and transmission is part of the central canon of the evolution and ecology of infectious disease. However, identifying directional and mechanistic relationships among traits remains a key challenge in various subfields of biology, as models often assume static, fixed links between characteristics. Here, we introduce learning evolutionary trait relationships (LETR), a data-driven framework that applies Granger-causality principles to determine which traits drive others and how these relationships change over time. LETR integrates causal discovery with generative mapping and transfer-operator analysis to link short-term predictability with long-term trait distributions. Using a synthetic myxomatosis virus-host data set, we show that LETR reliably recovers known directional influences, such as virulence driving transmission. Applying the framework to global pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) data, we find that past virulence improves future transmission prediction, while the reverse effect is weak. Invariant-density estimates reveal a long-term trend toward low virulence and transmission, with bimodality in virulence suggesting ecological influences or host heterogeneity. In summary, this study provides a blueprint for learning the relationship between how harmful a pathogen is and how well it spreads, which is highly idiosyncratic and context-dependent. This finding undermines simplistic models and encourages the development of new theory for the constraints underlying pathogen evolution. Further, by uniting causal inference with dynamical modeling, the LETR framework offers a general approach for uncovering mechanistic trait linkages in complex biological systems of various kinds.
