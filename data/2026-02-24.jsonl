GRNs play a critical role in diverse biological processes, including development, disease manifestation, and evolution. However, fully characterizing these networks across multiple cell types and states remains a significant challenge. Recent advances in single-cell omics have dramatically enhanced our ability to measure biological systems at unprecedented resolution. These technologies have opened new avenues for computational methods to infer GRNs, offering deeper insights into cell type-specific mechanisms, causality, and dynamic regulatory processes. This review summarizes the current state of GRN inference from single cell omic datasets, with a particular focus on dynamics and perturbations, and outlines key open challenges that must be addressed to advance the field."}

The associated decay rates are characterized in terms of the singular values of the stoichiometric matrix, convexity parameters, and time-integrated activities via deformed-exponential-type functions. We further extend these bounds within a generalized gradient flow framework. We highlight the biological relevance of this framework: the resulting bounds apply to quasi-steady-state regimes, where long transients and plateau-like behavior are common and functionally important. We illustrate the framework using a catalytic CRN exhibiting plateaus, where the bounds capture slow relaxation induced by local convexity and provide a bound-based approach to quantifying relaxation in CRNs."}

While large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to healthcare tasks, existing work focuses predominantly on diagnosis generation and risk prediction rather than post-prediction validation of detected signals. We introduce Project Hermes, a model-agnostic validation layer that treats signal confirmation as a sequential decision problem. Hermes operates downstream of arbitrary upstream predictors, using LLM-generated contextual queries to elicit targeted user feedback and performing Bayesian confidence updates to distinguish true positives from false alarms. In a 60-day longitudinal case study of migraine prediction, Hermes achieved a 34% reduction in false positive rate (from 61.7% to 12.5%) while maintaining 89% sensitivity, with mean lead time of 4.2 hours before symptom onset. Critically, Hermes does not perform diagnosis or make novel predictions; it validates whether signals detected by upstream models are clinically meaningful for specific individuals at specific times. This work establishes validation as a first-class computational problem distinct from prediction, with implications for trustworthy deployment of consumer health AI systems."}

Corresponding author: ygheisari@med.mui.ac.ir, Kaggle notebook is available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohammadgh009/aavgen", "summary": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are promising vectors for gene therapy, but their native serotypes face limitations in tissue tropism, immune evasion, and production efficiency. Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, structural analysis via AlphaFold3 confirms that the generated sequences preserve the canonical capsid folding despite sequence diversification. AAVGen establishes a foundation for data-driven viral vector engineering, accelerating the development of next-generation AAV vectors with tailored functional characteristics."}

Yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for various flight manoeuvres are important for understanding how agile flight can be accomplished. Even in a simple flight, multiple objectives are at play, complicating analysis of the overall flight mechanism. Using the data-driven method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) on motion capture recordings of hawks, we show that multiple behavioral states such as flapping, turning, landing, and gliding, can be modeled by simple and interpretable modal structures (i.e. the underlying wing-tail shape) which can be linearly combined to reproduce the experimental flight observations. Moreover, the DMD model can be used to extrapolate naturalistic flapping. Flight is highly individual, with differences in style across the hawks, but we find they share a common set of dynamic modes. The DMD model is a direct fit to data, unlike traditional models constructed from physics principles which can rarely be tested on real data and whose assumptions are typically invalid in real flight. The DMD approach gives a highly accurate reconstruction of the flight dynamics with only three parameters needed to characterize flapping, and a fourth to integrate turning manoeuvres. The DMD analysis further shows that the underlying mechanism of flight, much like simplest walking models, displays a parametric coupling between dominant modes suggesting efficiency for locomotion."}

While KRAS G12C is now targetable, no approved therapies exist for G12D. We examined time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) differences between G12C and G12D, allowing for time-varying hazard effects. Methods: De-identified data from AACR Project GENIE BPC NSCLC v2.0-public were analyzed. TTNT served as a real-world surrogate for progression-free survival. Co-mutations (TP53, STK11, KEAP1, SMARCA4, MET), TMB, and PD-L1 were harmonized. Kaplan-Meier, multivariable Cox, and a pre-specified piecewise Cox model (split at median TTNT = 23 months) were applied. Schoenfeld residuals assessed proportional hazards; bootstrap resampling (B=1000) evaluated stability. Results: Among 162 TTNT-evaluable patients (G12C n=130; G12D n=32), median TTNT was 28.6 versus 32.0 months (log-rank p=0.79). Adjusted Cox regression showed no overall hazard difference (HR=0.85; 95% CI 0.53-1.37; p=0.50), but Schoenfeld testing indicated borderline non-proportionality (p=0.053). Piecewise Cox modeling revealed time-varying effects: early TTNT hazard favored G12D (HR=0.41; 95% CI 0.17-0.97; p=0.043) with significant KRAS x period interaction (HR=3.33; p=0.021) and late-period attenuation (HR=1.38; 95% CI 0.77-2.47; p=0.285). Bootstrap resampling confirmed this pattern (median HRearly=0.39; HRlate=1.41). Among 278 OS-evaluable patients (133 deaths), G12D showed improved OS (adjusted HR=0.63; 95% CI 0.39-0.99; p=0.048). G12C tumors exhibited higher TMB (9.79 vs 7.83 mut/Mb; p=0.002) and greater STK11/KEAP1 enrichment. Conclusions: KRAS G12D demonstrated early TTNT advantage and improved OS. Late-period TTNT differences were non-significant (post-hoc power: 12.3%). These exploratory findings require validation in larger cohorts but support allele-specific therapeutic development for G12D."}

We eliminate this constraint by decoupling forward simulation from backward differentiation, with hard categorical sampling generating exact trajectories and gradients propagating through a continuous massively-parallel Gumbel-Softmax straight-through surrogate. Our approach enables accurate optimization at parameter scales over four orders of magnitude beyond existing simulators. We validate for accuracy, scalability, and reliability on a reversible dimerization model (0.09% error), a genetic oscillator (1.2% error), a 203,796-parameter gene regulatory network achieving 98.4% MNIST accuracy (a prototypical deep-learning multilayer perceptron benchmark), and experimental patch-clamp recordings of ion channel gating (R^2 = 0.987) in the single-channel regime. Our GPU implementation delivers 1.9 billion steps per second, matching the scale of non-differentiable simulators. By making exact stochastic simulation massively parallel and autodiff-compatible, our results enable high-dimensional parameter inference and inverse design across systems biology, chemical kinetics, physics, and related CTMC-governed domains."}

Despite its utility, adoption is hindered by high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation. In this work, we propose a unified Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework that bridges mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility. We introduce three contributions: (1) Foundation PBPK Transformers, which treat pharmacokinetic forecasting as a sequence modeling task; (2) Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models (PCDM), a generative approach that uses a physics-informed loss to synthesize biologically compliant virtual patient populations; and (3) Neural Allometry, a hybrid architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Neural ODEs to learn continuous cross-species scaling laws. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering a path to faster simulation."}

Interpretation of the point patterns generated by this technique presents challenges due to variable emitter density, incomplete bio-labelling of target molecules and their detection, error prone measurement processes, and the presence of spurious (non-structure associated) fluorescent detections. Together, these challenges ensure structural inferences from single-molecule imaging datasets are non-trivial in the absence of strong a priori information, for all but the smallest of point patterns. In addition, current methods often require subjective parameter tuning and presuppose known structural templates, limiting reference-free discovery. We present a statistically grounded, end-to-end analysis framework. Focusing on MINFLUX derived datasets and leveraging Bayesian and spatial statistical methods, a pipeline is presented that demonstrates 1) uncertainty aware clustering of measurements into emitter groups that performs better than current gold standards, 2) rapid identification of molecular structure supergroups, and 3) reconstruction of repeating structures within the dataset without substantial prior knowledge. This pipeline is demonstrated using simulated and real MINFLUX datasets, where emitter clustering and centre detection maintain high performance (emitter subset assignment accuracy > 0.75) across all conditions evaluated, while structural inference achieves reliable discrimination (F1 approx. 0.9) at high labelling efficiency. Template-free reconstruction of Nup96 and DNA-Origami 3x3 grids are achieved."}
